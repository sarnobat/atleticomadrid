=== 1930s ===

Athletic started the 1929-30 season at Real Madrid's Charmatin stadium, and also played some home fixtures back in their old stamping ground of the Campo de Vallecas. They eventually returned to the Metropolitano in January of 1930, but the upheaval clearly did not help, and Athletic finished bottom of La Primera and was relegated. During the summer of 1930, the Urbanizadora Metropolitana carried out another upgrade to the stadium, building a covers over the southern and northern sides of the ground, but also converting the athletics track to allow greyhound racing. This didn't curry any favours with the Spanish Federation, who apparently outlawed the use of the stadium.

So, Athletic returned to the east of Madrid and the Campo de Vallecas. The pitch at Vallecas was poor and over the next few seasons, the poor surface and disputes with the owners of the Metropolitano, saw the club criss-cross the capital, even playing matches back at Real Madrid's Chamartin. Athletic won promotion back to La Primera at the end of the 1933-34 season and played home matches during the 34-35 season at the Campo de Vallecas. The following season saw the club return to the Metropolitano, but this didn't inspire Athletic and they were, relegated. The La Segunda was the last thing on the club's mind when however, as war broke out on the 15 July 1936.
