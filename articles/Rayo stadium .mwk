====   ====
If you travel to the barrio of Vallecas in the south east of Madrid you will find one of Spain's more unconventional clubs, Rayo Vallecano. Rayo, which means lightening in Spanish, was founded in 1924 and kicked around in the local leagues for the next 25 years, By 1949 they were the district's senior team and debuted in the Tercera league as a subsidiary of Atlético Madrid. The club also adopted its distinctive red sash in 1949 after receiving shirts from Club River Plate of Argentina, who had used the club's Campo de El Rodival for training in the lead up to a friendly with Real Madrid. El Rodival remained the club's home ground until the mid-fifties, when it moved to Campo de Vallecas, the former home of Atlético Madrid.
