=== Aragones - Guillem Balague's view ===
====   ====
As I make the rules here, I'll introduce a new one. The man of the weekend was not a player (although he was once, and a very good one) but a coach – Luis Aragones. Mallorca 1-1 Real Sociedad was his 750th match as a coach in La Liga. He made his debut in 1974 with Atletico Madrid, his beloved club. He has been in charge of Atletico, Betis, Valencia, Sevilla, Espanyol, Barcelona, Oviedo and Mallorca. He is a hard man with no manners but he has the virtue of making players listen and respect his words. With a great psychological capacity, he is known as the Wise Man of Hortaleza, the place where he is from. He is not the coach with most titles (only one league, four cups, one intercontinental and one Spanish supercup) as he has always preferred to enjoy his work rather than coach the best – because of that, after taking Mallorca to the Champions League, he signed for Atletico Madrid, who needed him in the hell of the second division.
