<p>Written by Indranath Mukherjee on August 22, 2014
The league with the most free flowing football and an eye for goal is about to start. The duopoly was broken last year when a certain club from Madrid won La Liga and almost became the champions of Europe. Indranath Mukherjee goes back in time to focus on their illustrious history. Read on to know more with Goalden Times.
During the 2012–13 La Liga season, I had argued that Spanish football is more than the sum of the two giants—Barcelona and Real Madrid (here’s the quick link for people who missed it the first time around: Spanish Corner | Looking Beyond FC Barcelona And Real Madrid). Sure enough, we got a new league champion in Spain in 2013-14, with Club Atlético de Madrid winning the top honours.,With their passionate brand of football that almost gave them their first UEFA Champions League title until Sergio Ramos equalised in the third minute of the injury time in the final at Lisbon’s Estádio da Luz, Diego Simeone’s team was a revelation last season. A week before from somewhat similar situation at the Camp Nou, Diego Godín’s goal ensured La Liga for Atlético for the first time since 1996. Simeone, an ex-Atlético player (1994-1997 and 2003-2005) himself, took charge of the club in December 2011 when Gregorio Manzano was sacked after a poor show in La Liga. Atlético finished at number five in the league that season, but went on to win their second Europa League in three years. They started the following season by winning the 2012 UEFA Super Cup, thrashing previous season’s Champions League winner Chelsea 4-1. This was thanks to a first-half hat-trick by Radamel Falcao. They ultimately finished the season winning the Copa del Rey with an intense 2-1 win against city rival Real Madrid, ending a 14-year and 25-match winless streak in El Derbi Madrileño.
Much like Simeone, Atlético Madrid’s first series of triumphs came under another Argentine manager—Helenio Herrera. Under his able leadership, the team won consecutive league titles in 1950 and 1951. The club, in fact, had won its first consecutive titles when the league was resumed right after the Spanish Civil War in 1940, but its name was not Atlético Madrid then. The history of Atlético is actually one of the most complex and interesting in the annals of club football.
It all started when Ignacio Gortázar, Adolfo Artocha and Abdon of Alaiza—three Basques who were studying in Madrid— decided to start up some sort of a social club for the homesick Athletic Bilbao fans residing in the Spanish capital. As a result, a group of people met at café La Maison Doree in Alcala street on 26 April 1903, and another “Athletic” was established by the name of Athletic Club de Madrid. Their players wore the same blue and white shirt as Bilbao.
Atletico Madrid: 1925 2nd regional championship.
Atletico Madrid: 1925 2nd regional championship.
In the following year, some dissident members of Real Madrid joined the gang to provide further momentum to the club. On 22 January 1911, they played their first match in their now famous red and white striped shirts. These shirts were apparently made from cheap unused mattresses and soon earned the team the nickname of Los Colchoneros – Mattress-makers.
In 1913, Athletic de Madrid played and lost the final of Campeonato Regional de Madrid, the regional championship against Real Madrid—then known as Madrid Foot-Ball. If they had won, they would have qualified for the Copa del Rey, but the Spanish rules disallowed two connected clubs from participating in the same competition, and Athletic de Bilbao had already qualified. Next year, they cut all their ties with their Basque counterparts and became a fully independent football club.
Atlético’s first regional championship came in 1921 when they beat Real Unión de Irún in the final of Campeonato Regional de Madrid but lost 4-1 to Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final. Four years later, in 1925, they won the regional championship again and remained unbeaten in the tournament. However, they once again lost the Copa del Rey final to FC Barcelona.
Meanwhile, in 1923, Athletic moved to its own stadium—the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid—a stadium with the capacity to hold 35,800 spectators. This would continue to be their home ground till 1966.

The Spanish Civil War had a mixed impact on the club. When the league resumed in 1939 after the war, they were not playing in the top division. However, interestingly enough, they were still chosen to replace Real Oviedo since the latter’s ground was totally destroyed in the war.  But 8 footballers of Athletic’s starting 11 had perished in the bloody war. So, the club’s board requested Colonel Francisco Salamanca to merge his crack airforce team Aviación Nacional de Zaragoza with them and renamed them Athletic Aviación de Madrid. This was changed a few months later, by Franco’s order, to Atlético Aviación. For a team that was to play in the lower division, Aviación won the league in 1939-40. As if they had a point to prove, they did it again in 1940-41. This startling success came under Barcelona’s legendary goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora. whose managerial stint got off to a flyer much like his footballing career did.
In 1947, the club removed the military association from its name and became Club Atlético de Madrid. In the same year, they beat Real Madrid 5-0 at home in La Liga. This still remains their biggest win against their city rivals. That year, Atlético finished third behind Barcelona and Valencia, while Real came close to relegation and finished at number 11 in the 14-club league. Atlético’s consecutive wins in 1950 and 1951 will be remembered in the history of football for Helenio Herrera’s 3-2-5 formation. Managers and coaches in those days were mostly peripheral figures and clubs were best known by its players.But the legendary Herrera rose beyond these, and was one of the first limelight-hogging coaches.

</p><p>As soon as Herrera left Atlético to take charge of Malaga in 1952, the league became a tussle between László Kubala’s Barcelona and Alfredo di Stéfano’s Real Madrid.
Success in Europe kept eluding Atlético until 1962 when the club made it to the final of the European Cup Winners’ Cup. The final against Fiorentina at Hampden Park was hard fought and finished 1-1 after extra time. The replay, played four months later in Stuttgart, saw Atlético winning 3-0 to bag their first European title.Incidentally, it remains the only title to elude their more famous city rivals. They made it to the final in the next season as well but, sadly enough, got thrashed 5-1 by Tottenham Hotspur.

<p>Atlético of the early 1960s was a great side. But those were also the best days for Real Madrid. However, even then, Atlético managed to beat Real Madrid in back-to-back Copa del Rey finals in 1960 and 1961. In 1964, Atlético appointed Vicente Calderón as its new president. He immediately signed some new players, most important among them being Luis Aragonés. They claimed the Copa del Rey in 1964-65 with an impressive run to the final against Real Madrid, Valencia, Real Sociedad, and Zaragoza. They won the league the next season, finishing a point ahead of Real Madrid. However,  they had to sell the Estadio Metropolitano in 1966 to clear some of financial mess that the club was in. Next season, Luis Aragonés scored their first goal in the new stadium, Estadio Manzanares, which was later renovated and renamed the  Estadio Vicente Calderón in 1971.
Argentina’s Boca Juniors’ iconic footballer and coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo took over the managerial responsibility of Atlético in 1973 and led them to their first European cup final  against Bayern Munich in Brussels next year. Atlético were without the suspended Ruben Ayala, Ruben Díaz, and Quique in that final.All these players had been sent off in an ill-tempered game against Celtic in the semifinal in Glasgow, which Atlético still managed to keep goalless. They won their home game 2-0 to book their place in the final. Let’s not forget that Bayern, at that time, had footballers like Sepp Maier, Paul Breitner, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Uli Hoeneß in its starting line-up, but Atlético still took the lead with Aragonés’goal in the extra time. 30 seconds from the closing whistle, Bayern defender Georg Schwarzenbeck’s wonder strike from 25 yards beat the Atléti goalkeeper Miguel Reina and the game finished 1-1. The replay played just after 2 days on May 17th 1974 at the same venue,  and Bayern walked away with the title with its 4-0 win(2 goals each from Hoeneß and Müller).
Interestingly enough, Bayern refused to travel to Argentina to play against a physically tough Independiente side in the Intercontinental Cup, now known as the Club World Championship. As a result, Atlético got the chance and made the most out of it by winning the home match 2-0 with goals by Javier Irureta and Rubén Ayala. It was the first of many successes of Luis Aragonés who had retired and was promptly appointed as the Atlético coach.
In 1975-76, Aragonés’ men won their fifth Copa del Rey, and, in the following season got the league for the eighth time, beating Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona in a thrilling title race. What followed was the dreariest period in the club’s history.
After winning the league title in 1976-77, Atlético had just won a sole Copa del Rey in 1984-85 before Jesús Gil y Gil, the club’s most controversial president till date, took over in 1987. Fans were getting impatient and Gil came into power by promising to sign the Portuguese left winger Paulo Futre, a crucial member of the European Cup winner with F.C. Porto. They won the Copa del Rey in the consecutive years of 1991 and 1992, but the club was going through a financial mess and Gil kept buying players and sacking managers. One of Gil’s biggest blunders was to shut down Atlético’s famous youth academy in 1992—a move which prompted a certain 15-year-old academy player Raúl Gonzalez to join the city rivals and achieve international fame.Finally, after 19 years, the league was won in 1995-96. Copa del Rey was won that year as well, making it a double success for coach Radomir Antic’s Atlético. The team now had players like José Luis Caminero, Diego Simeone, Milinko Pantić, and Francisco Miguel Narváez Machón aka Kiko. This success followed further signings of Christian Vieri, Juninho Paulista, and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the following few seasons. These marquee but thoughtless signings, however, also pushed the club closer to bankruptcy.
While the club was in such an unstable state due to the shenanigans of Jesús Gil and his eponymous political party, GIL, ( ironically enough, IL stood for Independent Liberals)  some of the players were being investigated for undeclared incomes. Paulo Futre later admitted to receiving £2.5 million in backhander. To make things even worse, a member of the neo-Nazi group Bastion stabbed a Real Sociedad fan outside Vicente Calderón in 1998. The perpetrator was sentenced to 20 years’ jail in 2001.
Gil and his board members got suspended for various financial crimes, including embezzlement from his own club, in 1999.And Gil was finally arrested in 2000. The club’s performance on the pitch had also reached its nadir by then, with them getting relegated for Segunda in 1999-2000 after Hasselbaink failed to convert from the spot on the last day of the league against Real Oviedo. Claudio Ranieri, the manager, resigned. Once more, in stepped Aragonés, and got the club back in the top division after missing out the chance narrowly in the previous season. Gil’s ghost was still around Vicente Calderón as his son took charge of the club while he was busy clearing the multiple charges of financial malpractices brought against him. Fans, by that time, were well and truly sick of the corruption and had started chanting ‘Gil carbon, fuera del Calderón’(Gil, you bustard, get out of Calderon) during various games.

Finally, Gil resigned in May 2003 after sacking 36 managers (6 in one season) and leaving Atlético 80 million euros in debt a month after the official celebration of the club’s centenary. Although Real Madrid never considered Atlético to be a serious competitor, their ways of celebrating their centenaries provide certain interesting sociological perspectives. Real invited Plácido Domingo to sing in their centenary, while Rolling Stones rocked at Atlético’s. Real Madrid had a banquet whose invitees included the country’s president, members of royal family, and other VIPs, while Atlético cooked a giant paella and offered it to the crowd gathered outside the stadium for the game against Osasuna. Although they lost the game that day, the nature of the celebration suited a club that has never embraced any social pretensions.
Real Madrid had a banquet whose invitees included the country’s president, members of royal family, and other VIPs, while Atlético cooked a giant paella and offered it to the crowd gathered outside the stadium for the game against Osasuna.
Real Madrid’s indifference towards Atlético as a rival (which is mostly because Real wants to save it all for Barcelona) has always been treated as a snub by Atlético fans. These fans, along with  those of Sporting Gijón, are the most feared set of spectators in Spain. There is something unique and uninviting about Atlético fans. They prefer that you hate them. In fact, they thrive on it. Gil was a master at exploiting this ‘bad boys’ image to blame every lost game on politics and the referees’ association.
After coming back to the top division in Spain, we have seen inconsistent domestic performances from Atlético in spite of good footballers like Diego Forlán, Luis García, Simão, José Antonio Reyes, Sergio Agüero, and Radamel Falcao playing for them. They won the UEFA Europa League in 2009-10 and 2011-12, the second time under Diego Simeone, who seems poised to make Atlético a serious rival to both Real Madrid and Barcelona. Though whether they will be able to continue their last year’s performance is something that remains to be seen, it cannot be denied that they have done exceptionally well in the transfer market this season. They lost some of their key players, including their last season’s highest scorer Diego Costa to Chelsea. Their super goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois on loan from Chelsea has also gone back to his club. Full back Filipe Luís will play for the blues in London too. But they have signed enough players, including Mario Mandžukić, Antoine Griezmann, Miguel Ángel Moyà, Jan Oblak, Sílvio Manuel Pereira, and Jesús Gámez to back-fill. Simeone is clearly looking to create a solid squad that will not just be a one-season wonder.

Atlético Madrid will move out of Vicente Calderón and move to the renovated Estadio La Peineta in 2016. Fans are not excited about the shift but if the club continues to win trophies, they should hardly have anything to complain about. For now, only time will tell whether the mattress-makers manage to pose a serious threat to Real Madrid and their one-sided dominance of football in Madrid.

<p>Madrid's other team and, to all Glasgow Celtic fans, one of the most vicious bunch of thugs ever to take the field in a European Cup tie. El Atleti have always lived under the giant shadow of Real; a pauper compared to Real's aristocracy. While Real are all style, Atletico have earned a reputation as the thought police of world football. However, times have changed and the likes of Juninho have blunted the hard edge.
</p>

<p>Atletico have had to fight for everything. Franco favoured Real who deemed them unworthy of even rival status. The club has always been on the defensive, reflected by their choice of coaches. The master of the catenacio Helenio Herrera brought the club two Liga titles. Austrian disciplinarian Max Merkel followed him, but the club's uncompromising reputation was built around Juan Carlos Lorenzo. He played for the infamous Argentinian side, Estudaintes, in the late 60's and was more than eager to emplor the same tactics in Europe. They kicked their way to the European Cup final in 1974 before falling to Bayern Munich in a replay. Lorenzo's boys had two sent off in the semi-final against the Bhoys of Celtic and a reputation was cemented.

<p>While the playing staff have failed to live up to the 70's hard-men, president Jesus Gil has kept the club in the headlines through fist-fights, public slanging matches and all manner of threats and outrageous proclamation.s Thirty coaches have come and gone since the mayor of Marbella took over in the mid-80s. He reduced Arrigo Sacchi to tears and early retirement, but has put his money where his mouth is and given his coaches untold financial backing. Radi Antic is a brave man though, returning for his second spell under the axe-man Gil.

<p>Gil's millions are evident all round the club. The city of Marbella sponsors the club and one of Gil's property development offices are under the main stand. As long as Gil keeps the money coming in Atletico won't have many sleepless nights.

<p>Atletico are more famous for their coaches than players. Spain's greatest goalkeeper and national hero, Ricardo Zamora, led the team to two titles in the early 40s and Helenio Herrera did the same 10 years later. However, it is Vicente Calderon who deserves the greatest credit. The late president fought a constant battle to keep the club afloat while Real ruled the world. More recently, anyone from the title-winning team of 1996 is hailed as a hero.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Who_is_the_cult_hero.3F">Who is the cult hero?</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=CLIParser&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: Who is the cult hero?">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h5>
<p>Long-term injury victim Kiko in the many the team misses more than any other. The striker led the scoring charts when the club won the title in '96 and until his ankles gave out this season he was still the fans' favourite. Christian Vieri nearly won that honour, but when he quit the club for Lazio his name became dirt.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Who_is_the_current_crowd_favourite.3F">Who is the current crowd favourite?</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/mediawiki/index.php?title=CLIParser&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Who is the current crowd favourite?">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h5>
<p>In a team of international stars it is the young Spanish striker Jose Mari who gets the fans to their feet. His perfect balance, quick feet and incisive dribbling have drawn comparisons to Michael Laudrup. Roberto, who can play either on the right of midfield or up front, is another rising star. Juninho will always be a favourite and is finally returning to his pre-injury form.

<p>With the players losing their Sacchi inhibitions the season is looking much brighter. The Italian coach dropped Juninho and left the young players out in favour of his countrymen. Temporary coach Carlos Sanchez Aguiar brought back the Brazilian, dropped the ineffective central defender Torrisi and told everyone to have a bit of fun. Now Antic has got Atletico playing enterprising football again.

<p>The industrial south-west of the city doesn’t have many attractions and the area around the Estadio Vicente Calderon is grim and colourless. The stadium is tucked in between the Manzanares river and a series of sweeping dual carriageways. Although the San Isidro cemetery is on one side and the local Mahou brewery on the other, the Calderon does have a faded charm of its own. The red-and-white striped façade needs a lick of paint, but the bars below the stand are real working-class shrines to the club. It may not have the glamour of the Bernabeu, but there is a down-to-earth feeling and there’s even a bar inside the ground selling Mahou beer, or course.

<p>It’s not far from the old centre of the city and the excellent metro network takes you there in no time. Take Metro Line 5 to Piramides then head right across the large Glorieta de las Piramides roundabout. You won’t see the stadium until you are halfway down the hill, but when you do it looks like a giant circus tent.

<p>Even with a capacity of 62,000 the all-seater Calderon feels quite compact. The steep tiers offer good views but be warned: three sides are uncovered. The covered side is called the preferente with the palco preference B being the most expensive at around 9,000 ptas. A VIP box with room for 25 seats has just been opened and there are plans for further expansion. At the other end of the scale, behind the goals in the anfiteatro de fonde norte or sur the views are still excellent and you get closer to the ultra culture. Prices start at around 3,000 ptas. The Atletico hardcore head to the fonde sur, so it’s worth going to the fonde norte to take in the choreography at the other end.

<p>Unless Real or Barcelona are the visitors, there are no problems getting a ticket even on match day.

<p>Los colchoneros (the Mattress Makers) – so named after their red and white shirts originally borrowed from Athletic Bilbao – have one of the best-organized and colourful followings around. The main ultra group, El Frente Atletico (the Atletico Heads), who stand in the fonde sur, are the closest thing to Italian ultras in Spain. They sing and chant for the full 90 minutes, wave the red, white and blue flags and bash out an incessant drumbeat, backed by what seems to be native-American chanting. There is even a racoon mascot dressed in a native-American headgear who runs on before kick-off to gee everyone up.

<p>Not quite. They also have repertoire of cheesy 70s pop songs. They may like to sit and be entertained in the Bernabeu, but in the Calderon they want to get involved.

<p>Just about. Atletico have a strong travelling support which has made its presence felt at away games. Like Real fans, they sing about Madrid’s regional pride which doesn’t go down well in other parts of their country.

<p>Atletico draw their support from the solid working-class districts in the centre and south of the city. They are proud that the club wears the city’s emblem on their shirts. As Real think a game against Barcelona is more important, el Atleti will do anything to put one over them. Real’s exit from the Champions’ League this season caused just as frenzied celebrations as Atletico’s victory over Roma in the UEFA Cup. A derby game is still the most important to win – even if it is only for vocal and colourful support.

<p>You’ll certainly stand out in the crowd wearing the famous red-and-white shirts. The stripes on the sleeves have been replaced with faded-red that darkens towards the cuffs. The blue shorts are stylish and baggy. Of course, the mark of Gil is on the front of the shirt, but it’s still a cool kit.

<p>It takes something like winning the Liga title or a Gil outburst for Atletico to make the front pages of the Madrid-based newspapers Marca and AS. You will have to dig back into around page 10 to find news on the club and then it is never as interesting or  as outlandish as Real’s coverage.

GIL FAMILY: 25 YEARS IN THE BOX OF THE CALDERON (Now almost 30)
In the start of June 1987, Brian De Palma just aired “The Untouchables” for the first time, a movie ambiented in the 30s with the Dry Law in the USA, which was awarded with 4 nominations for the Oscars (Sean Connery got one for Best Actor in Supporting Role). In those days, Madonna was touring in Japan, Whitney Houston was smashing selling records in the US with her new album, and, in Spain, David Bowie managed to get to the first position in Los 40 Principales list (quite surprising considering that's a radio for mainstream music). Talking about sports, Wimbledon had a massive surprise for us when Ivan Lendl, who was at that time in a more than 2 year streak of best ATP player, lost in 3 sets against the aussie Pat Cash.
That same June of 1987, day 27, D. Jesus Gil was elected as the president of Atletico de Madrid. An appoinment which lead, a few years later, an endless list of judicial processes, fraud and misaproppiation accusations, faked documents, uses of club's money to his own return, inflations of the price of some players who never were professionals, of taking a club which was considered one of the 3 or 4 best teams in Spain, to lift only 6 trophies in 25 years, with a relegation included. This is the case of Gil family, joined very tight to the name of Enrique Cerezo, up front of a Sports Limited Company (SAD, Sociedad Anonima Deportiva), before a Football Club. It's the history of how a club owned by
