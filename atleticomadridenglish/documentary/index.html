Notes: <br>
* Once you've gotten through a first pass, keep subtracting from it so you have a skeleton story. Then re-flesh it out, it will be a more focused story.<br>
* avoid dates. Otherwise we end up letting those dictate the flow of the story which defeats the purpose of this document ("in 1946 atletico did xyz, then in 1953 Atletico did abc" - the dates become the segue instead of the story).
* The documentary is about overcoming odds through defiance. Anything more than this will be too complicated to hold the audience's understanding and interest in.

<h3>Act 1: In the Shadows (1903-1938)</h3>
<!-- HERO's JOURNEY: Ordinary World -->
	<h4>Neither Here Nor There</h4>

	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Atletico_madrid_1911.jpg/250px-Atletico_madrid_1911.jpg" height=150><br>

	Atletico Madrid started as a club without its own identity. It was founded as an organization to serve Madrid-based members of the Athletic Club in Bilbao. But Madrid's football players are spectators were already served by another club, Madrid FC (and a few others - see rsssf).

	<!-- HERO's JOURNEY: Call to Adventure -->
	<h4>Initial attempts</h4>

	Atletico were almost 20 years old by the time they won the regional championship for the first time, and they would go on to win it twice more during the 1920s. Each of these wins qualified them for the national knockout tournament for undisputed supremacy.
	<br>

	<!-- HERO's JOURNEY: Refusal of the Call -->
	<h4>Dreaming of National supremacy</h4>
<img src="http://www.colchonero.com/media/galeria/4/2/2/2/6/o_atletico_de_madrid_submundo_historia-6866222.jpeg">
	Twice they came close to winning the national tournament but were defeated the first time by their once-owners Bilbao and the other by separatist flagbearers Barcelona.<br>
	<br>
	The popularity of the sport in Spain made it profitable to create a national league championship. The lineage of the regional championship was doomed and with it, Atletico's history of success and legitimacy as a professional football club.<br>
	<br>
	In its first 8 years, the 3 aforementioned rivals Bilbao, Barcelona and Real Madrid would pick up 7 and establish their place at the summit of Spanish football. Atletico Madrid, at the other end of the table, dropped out of the merit-based national league. They made it back without winning the 2nd division's national league, but were found out soon and finished in the relegation positions of the first division again disappearing back into obscurity.

	<br>

<h3>Act 2: Earning Respect (1939-2001)</h3> <!-- Earning respect-->
	<h4>Down and Out. But now for the bad news... (1939)</h4>

	<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ba0YGH3.jpg" height=150><br>

	Football became the last thing on Spanish people's minds and lives that same year as fascist forces overthrew the republican (?) government amid claims of corruption.<br>
	<br>
	Football competition was suspended as players served in the war or fled to safety. After 2 years of brutal warfare, stadiums across Spain were in ruins and players dead including Atletico's.<br>
	<br>
	The damage to the stadium of one of Real Oviedo, who had won the 2nd division just days before war was officially declared, left them without a place to play their first division matches. This left one vacant spot in the 1st division.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Vacancy (1939)</h4>
	<img src="http://www.footballcitizens.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/carteldef.png">
	The two clubs that were relegated during the most recent campaign had the opportunity to reclaim their status in the 1st division. The playoff took place in Valencia's Mestalla stadium against Osasuna, and Atletico won it 3-1. Atletico were again part of the first division contestants.<br>
	<br>
	But by this point, Atletico Madrid were not the Atletico Madrid that the people had once known. The Spanish Airforce football team, Aviacion Nacional, established by Franco 2 years earlier in Salamanca was redeployed to Madrid and had no stadium to play in either. Aviacion Nacional, coached by Real goalkeeping great Ricardo Zamora, approached Real Madrid about a merger but Real Madrid snubbed it due to the insistance of the airforce in incorporating the word "Aviacion" in the club's name. They then approached Atletico Madrid, and a deal was struck. The new club would be called Athletic Aviacion.<br>
	<br>
	Atletico's Metropolitano stadium too was severely damaged by the war. Unlike Real Oviedo, there were other stadiums Atletico had the option of temporarily playing elsewhere in the Spanish capital. Suburb Vallecas, home of Rayo Vallecano, was also uninhabitable. Atletico ended up playing their early games in the first post-war national league in a stadium in the northern part of the city - the Chamartin stadium of Real Madrid (the original Chamartin, not the one that was later renamed the Bernabeu)! Real Madrid socios were allowed free access to Atletico's "home" games and would greet their local rivals with jeers every time.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Relocated and Reequipped (1939)</h4>
	<img src="http://unionistascf.com/images/grada_vieja/08_Unionistas_Salamanca_Club_Futbol_Ricardo_Zamora3.jpg">
	But this new team had inherited the discipline and toughness of the military which saw them mount a challenge for the national league title (having won the last ever regional league title that same season). By the time the national league title's destination was to be decided, the team were playing at Vallecas. The spectators present in that stadium saw Atletico defeat Valencia 2-0 and claim their first ever national league title.

	<!-- HERO's JOURNEY: Tests, Allies and Enemies -->
	<h4>On the Map, finally (1940)</h4>


	<img src="http://www.kaisermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/san-lorenzo-Aviaci%C3%B3n-foto-MARCA.gif" height=150><br>

	Atletico's association with the military ended. A few days later they and the whole of Europe developed an infatuation with Argentine champions San Lorenzo. They and many other teams were humbled by the touring team with their sophisticated team play. Less than a year later they played Stade Francais, managed by Argentine-born Helenio Herrera.<br>
	<br>
	<h5>Across the borders (1947)</h5>
	<img src="http://rs77.pbsrc.com/albums/j43/screamo_769/BenBarek-HelenioHerrera-1.jpg~c200">
	<!-- Fix the tenses -->
	Helenio Herrera's father had been exiled from Andalucia due to his anarchist support, but they had left Argentina for Casablanca, a French colony at the time. 21 year old Herrera played for the local team, where he met a 16 year old local sensation Larbi Benbarek. Herrera soon moved to Paris, and a few years later Benbarek moved to Marseilles. When Herrera hung up his boots and went into management, one of his first acts was to bring Benbarek, now in his 30s, to Paris to play for Stade Francais. The two brought the club into the French first division at the end of their first season, finishing 5th in a league of 18 teams both times.<br>
	<br>
	Their 2-legged friendly with Atletico was again a mesmerizing experience, so much so that days later they signed Marcel Domingo and Benbarek, now 34 but still a class apart. They linked up with new Argentine manager Lino Traioli. Herrera, spent the next 12 months at Valladolid where he successfully avoided relegation in the club's first ever top flight season. He linked back up with his Stade Francais duo and the trio immediately made history together, winning the club's 3rd league title and first under the name Atletico Madrid.<br>
	<br>
	Real Madrid also recognized of Argentine, signing Alfredo Di Stefano in controversial circumstances. Together with compatriot Hector Rial (a youth team player with the great San Lorenzo side), the two helped Real win the first three European Cups along with the 4 league titles during the 50s.<br>
	<br>
	Real's dominance at home and in Europe left the backdoor for Atletico to embark on their first European Cup campaign as league runners-up. Atletico stood in the way of Real Madrid's 4th European cup final. It was an even 2-legged tie as both sides refused to concede city supremacy. A 3rd match was contested on neutral territory in Zaragoza's Romerada stadium. Ultimately financial power prevailed, as Real reached and won the final in Stuttgart.
	<br>
	<img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mxWfzNjsVVQ/Uyth0nRXltI/AAAAAAAAQok/bnOSNEwetpM/s1600/20140225As2MadridAtletico1959+Diario+AS+Metropolitano.gif" height=150>

	<h5>Money talks (1959)</h5>
	"If you can't beat them, join them," goes the old saying. That summer Atletico approached the man that had guided Real to their first 2 European Cups, Jose Villalonga. He duly obliged, ending his 2 year sabbatical. During that same 2 year period a young midfielder Adelardo Rodriguez established himself at Badajoz. Real Madrid had just won their 5th European Cup final at Hampden Park 7-3. Atletico's league campaign ended the same as the previous season in 5th place, but reached the Spanish Cup final - a feat Atletico had only managed once over a 30 year period that ended in defeat to double-winning Athletic Bilbao. There was one problem. Standing in their way were Real Madrid, who had convinced the continent that they were superior and that Atletico had no hope. As if that wasn't enough of a mismatch, the final would be held at the Bernabeu (footnote: the last 12 cup finals had been held there since it was built).

	<!-- HERO's JOURNEY: Point of no return -->
	<h5>Coming out fighting (1960)</h5>

	That hoodoo looked set to continue as Puskas scored in the first half, just like he'd done in the first leg of the European Cup tie, and in the playoff decider. But with the mastermind in the away dressing room of the Bernabeu stadium, Atletico turned the match on its head and ran out 3-1 winners.<br>
	<br>
	The following season Atletico finished 2nd, but were well behind Real Madrid who were now 5-time and reigning European Cup winners. Real Madrid had been dumped out of the competition for the first time by Barcelona. Real were desperate to finish the season on a high note and inevitably Puskas scored in the first half. Peiro, who ended the scoring in the previous year's final equalized, and within seconds of the restart put Atletico Madrid ahead. Ultimately Atletico Madrid won the final, and in a best-of-3 series in cup ties they got the last laugh, if not the loudest.<br>

	<!-- HERO's JOURNEY: Mid-Point -->
	<!-- <h5>Not so fast / Don't forget about us</h5> -->
	<h5>Not going away quietly (1961)</h5>
	<img src="http://estaticos03.marca.com/albumes/2012/05/02/atleticograndesnoches/1335970926_extras_albumes_0.jpg">
	Real Madrid's European stranglehold had ended, but they continued to dominate the domestic scene by winning 5 successive league titles.<br>
	<br>
	Atletico meanwhile continued to make their name in cup competitions. Atletico's 2nd successive Cup final win against Real Madrid qualified them for the UEFA Cup Winners Cup. Fiorentina had won the inaugural UEFA Cup Winners Cup that same year, and the Italians reached the final to defend their title against Atletico at Hampden Park, the scene of Real's last European Cup win. They did not repeat the feat of their neighbours 2 years earlier as the 2 sides remained deadlocked at 1-1. There was no time to even settle the tie with teams having to report for World Cup duty in Chilie. Helenio Herrera was now managing the country of his family's origin. The national team could not match the accomplishments of their capital's clubs, but Atletico did continue their wider goal of recognition. Spain's 2 goals at the tournament were both by Atletico players: Adelardo and Collar.<br>
	<br>
	The club's success made the national federation raid Atletico for their coach extraordinaire. Vilalonga left to replace Herrera as manager of Spain.<br>
	<br>
	Atletico meanwhile had the unfinished business of the Cup Winners Cup final. A replay was held at Stuttgart at the start of the new season with a new coach. Jones, Mendonca and Peiro, heroes of their double victory against Real Madrid in previous seasons were again the difference. Victory was extra-redeeming for Atletico fans as it was held in Stuttgart, where they would have played had they won that playoff in Zaragoza 3 years earlier.<br>
	<br>
	With Vilalonga gone, one would have expected the successful cup campaigns to have gone with him (indeed Vilalonga's fame reached another level when he guided Spain to the 1964 European Championship trophy at his old stamping ground the Bernabeu). But Atletico reached the Cup Winners Cup final again. Their defence of the trophy was contingent on beating Tottenham Hotspur. In their ranks was Jimmy Greaves, who'd just finished top goalscorer in the English league for the 3rd season in a row (once winning the league for Spurs). Atletico Madrid were favourites, but after a game that was close for an hour, Atletico ended up on the wrong end of a 5-1 scoreline.<br>
	<br>
	Losing a cup final became a familiar experience as they lost to Zaragoza in the final of the Spanish cup a year later, with Cardona's goal after the hour mark not being enough to overcome Zaragoza's 2 first half goals. <br>
	<br>
	Honduran Jose Enrique Cardona, along with Luis Aragones, had been signed at the beginning of the post-season to play in the cup tournament by new club president Vicente Calderon (Brazilian-raised Spaniard Ufarte joined soon after the cup final defeat).
	<br>
	<br>
	<h5>A cup team (1964)</h5>
<img src="http://www.radiohouse.hn/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CARDONA-e1456550975186.jpg">
	Calderon had stepped in to replace Javier Barroso (former player), who had resigned amid economic problems, with a half-build stadium.<br>
	<br>
	Atletico Madrid had long recognized the need for a larger stadium, issuing debt back in 1958 <!-- a year after the Camp Nou had opened --> and beginning construction on a new stadium in 1961. Calderon was charged with funding the new stadium construction through to completion. The Metropolitano, at its peak, held 58,000 fans and was no match for Barcelona's Camp Nou that boasted a 90,000 plus capacity, while Real Madrid could be watched by 100,000 plus at the Bernabeu (2nd Chamartin renamed in 1955). Real Madrid, having relinquished their stranglehold on the European Cup, continued to dominate domestically with 4 successive league titles.<br>
	<br>
	<!-- 
	With a run of 3 cup final wins followed by 2 cup final defeats, Atletico made it to the cup final again the following season. 
	<br>
	<br>
	-->
	<!-- 
	Atletico had established themselves as cup specialists while Real Madrid continued to take home the big prize with 5 successive league titles. Results and trophy cabinets aside, the visible difference between the 2 was already clear. Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium (2nd Chamartin renamed in 1955) could house more than 100,000 fans, while Barcelona's Camp Nou held more than 90,000. The Metropolitano's expansion in the 1950s brought its capacity only up to 58,000. <br>
	<br>
	 -->
	<!-- Atltico's lack of a modern sueprstadium like Real's was an unconcealable sign that they were not on Real Madrid's level. Vicente Calderon  -->

	Calderon ended his first full season as president with his club with a rematch against Zaragoza. This time there were no goals in the first half, but the same man Cardona popped up just after the hour mark to grab the only goal of the game and win Atletico Madrid's 3rd Spanish cup (footnote: Zaragoza would reach their 4th successive cup final the following season and beat Atletico's conquerors Bilbao in the final).<br>
	<br>
	The Metropolitano had been sold to continue the new stadium work, but it had not been completed in time for Atletico to play in <!--at the beginning of 1965-->. As a result, Atletico had played matches in Calderon's first season at the Bernabeu again.<br>
	<br>
	A deal was brokered to rent the soon-to-be-demolished Metropolitano for another season. 
	<!-- South Americans, Hardmen -->

	<h5>New era (1966)</h5>

	Another Spaniard raised in South America, Garate, joined the champions. Atletico Madrid's first home game of the new season was on matchday 3. The new stadium wasn't the finished article, with the stand on the river side incomplete.<br>
	<br>
	The next few seasons would see limited progress on the pitch either in the league or cup. First round elimination from the European Cup was the last they would see of Europe that decade (footnote: the Uefa Cup was created in 1971). The only recognition the club obtained in this period was Garate's award of the pichichi. Long-time greats Collar and Griffa would leave the club, with Ovejero joining. Former player Marcel Domingo returned to the club as manager after working for a decade at smaller Spanish clubs.<br>
	<br>
	Just like in 1966, Atletico would win their final league match 2-0 in Catalunya (this time at Sabbadel) to confirm first place. Ufarte would grab one of the goals. Garate would retain his pichichi trophy by finishing joint top scorer, along with teammate Luis Aragones (footnote: and a Real player).<br>
	<br>
	That summer Alfredo di Stefano, so often the scourge of Atletico, took over as Valencia coach. His team led the league almost nonstop for the 2nd half of the season. At the start of play on the final day Valencia lead Atletico and Barcelona by 2 points. In a tense situation, Atletico hosted Barcelona with both sides able to clinch the title if they won and Valencia lost. Barcelona took the lead late in the first half, but Valencia were goalless at Espanyol staying a point ahead of them. Garate pulled Atletico back level restoring Valencia's 2 point cushion. Espanyol scored less than 10 minutes after Garate's equalizer, which meant that Valencia's were now just 1 point ahead of Atletico and level on points with Barcelona. Valencia still held the edge from their win at the Nou Camp in the first half of the season. In the final 25 minutes, whoever scored next would take the title. None of the 3 teams did so and so Valencia left the Sarria with the title just as Atletico had done 5 years earlier. Marcel Domingo left and was replaced by Austrian Max Merkel who had a track record of trophies in Austria and Germany, plus experience in the Spanish league with Sevilla.<br>
	<br>
	Valencia, Barcelona and Atletico finished in the same relative league ranking the following season, though unfortunately for Valencia they couldn't catch Real Madrid who led the table for almost the entire season. Valencia got a some token revenge eliminating Real in the semi finals in the cup, and were seeking third timer's luck in the final having lost the previous two finals to Real and Barcelona. Standing in their way this time were Atletico Madrid.<br>
	<br>
	Atletico's first half lead lasted just 5 minutes. Garate would restore the lead just after the hour mark to win the cup for Atletico. Calleja had decided to retire at the end of the season and went out on a high, lifting the cup as captain.
<br>


	<h5>Seconds from glory (1974)</h5>
	74-75 : lost twice on penalties
	<!-- 
	Atletico Madrid won the league in their last ever season at the Metropolitano, with the next season due to be the first at the modern new and bigger stadium, and the club lived happily ever after.<br>
	<br>
	If it wasn't already clear by now, Atletico was not the kind of club where things go smoothly. 
	 -->
	 
	 Aragones decided to take a sabbatical from Atletico, and after failing to find a successful replacement and enduring Atletico's worst league finish since the 1930s (?), Calderon himself stepped down due to deteriorating health. 
	 
	<h5>Stepping down (1980)</h5>
	<img src="http://cloud10.todocoleccion.online/libros-futbol/tc/2013/05/30/37473432.jpg">
	 <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_QDRyQn4wHs/hqdefault.jpg">	
	 Burgos CF finished bottom of the table that season, and new club president Alfonso Cabeza brought in their manager Jose Luis Garcia Triad who had made his name with consecutive promotions with Salamanca into the top tier for the first time in the club's history.
	 
	 His team led the league table for 25 consecutive weeks, until a home match against Real Zaragoza refereed by Alvarez Margüenda. It was a match that Atletico lost, and was too much for Cabeza to take (Atleti had a goal disallowed, got 2 red cards, and the referee did not seem to take any action against Zaragoza's harsh fouls and tackles on Atleti's player). After repeatedly criticizing refereeing he got banned from presidency. Atletico failed to win any of their final 7 league matches, which allowed Real Sociedad to claim their first ever league title.
	 
	 
	 After ownership of the club being hot passed around like a hot potato, Vicente Calderon returned to take over the mess created in his absence. His first point of business was to bring back Luis Aragones. 
	 
	<h5>Reunited (1982)</h5>
	 <img src="https://golregate.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/luis-aragones-y-vicente-calderon-atletico-de-madrid.jpg?w=750">	
	 The 2 quietly rebuilt Atletico back to something resembling its former respectable self, but the Basque country was getting all the spotlight, buyoed by the end of the Franco's nationalist regime and oppression of the region's identity. Real Sociedad retained their league title, before rivals Bilbao did likewise in the next 2 seasons (the latter being a double) under manager Javier Clemente. The 2 were on a collision course, with Atletico romping to a 4-0 win at the Bernabeu at the expense of rookies Butrugeno, Michel and Sanchis. For just the 3rd time in its history, the Copa Del Rey would be a battle of the red and white Athletic clubs. The difference between the sides would be just-crowned pichichi winner Hugo Sanchez, whose brace won it for Atletico as they ended an 8 year trophy drought.
	 
	 The hero would soon turn villain, as the Mexican joined Real Madrid that summer. English clubs had just been banned from European competition for 5 years after repeated hooliganism, culminating in the Heysel tragedy. The Scottish and Welsh were not included in that blacklist, allowing a once-in-a-lifetime tie for Welsh minnows Bangor City, and a rematch with Celtic (which was played behind closed doors in Glasgow), the team Atletico had beaten to reach Heysel 11 years earlier. They'd make it all the way to the final just like in 1974, but again came away with silver medals after being well-beaten by the club coached by Valeri Lobonovsky that would provide 12 out of the Sovient Union's 22 players for the World Cup in Mexico the following month, spearheded by the excellent Belanov. Aragones ended his 2nd major spell as manager with the club during pre-season for health reasons (though again would find himself back as caretaker coach with the club desperately in need).
	 
	 The 73-year old president would die of a heart attack. The club was in mourning, rendering the 4-1 defeat at the Bernabeu two days later, and 4-0 home defeat to Barcelona, comparatively meaningless. 
	 
	 <h4>Loss of lifeblood (1987)</h4>
	<img src="http://estaticos04.marca.com/albumes/2012/03/24/calderon_atletico/1332590854_extras_albumes_0.jpg"> 
	 The club pulled itself together, continuing to make progress in the copa del rey. In the semi finals they faced Real. Again Atletico found themselves 3 goals down at the Bernabeu (Sanchez getting 2 of them), but this time pulled 2 goals back to give themselves a realistic chance of overturning the narrow deficit. It was goalless in the first half of the 2nd leg, but two goals in the 2nd half earnt them a place in the final. They would face John Toshak's Real Sociedad, who'd similarly eliminated their local rivals Bilbao in the semi final. In a dress rehearsal for the league campaign that was on its penultimate matchday, Atletico beat Sociedad 5-1 at the Calderon, though Sociedad finished the season 1 place above Atletico. Real Sociedad had only won the competition once - 78 years earlier. It was Atletico's first neutral match at the Romareda since the European Cup semi final playoff. The final was a much closer affair, and went to penalties. The Basque team would prevail, with Quique Ramos missing the 4th spot kick. There would be no trophy to dedicate to their recently departed president. Instead the newly elected president Jesus Gil took charge the day after the cup final.

	<h5>New President, New Vision</h5>
	<img src="http://netgear.rohidekar.com:44452/e/Sridhar/Atletico%20Madrid/pictures/Other/Gil/calderon_y_gil.jpg">

	Jesus Gil had big ambitions, promising the signing of Paulo Futre, who'd just helped Porto win the European Cup.
	
	He also chose not to renew Aragones' contract and bring in world cup winning Argentine coach Cesar Luis Menotti (footnote: Ron Atkinson had had a handshake agreement with Calderon shortly before his passing). Menotti achieved a couple of memorable results, including Atletico's second 4-0 win at the Bernabeu in the decade (with Sanchez this time being on the wrong end) and the club's biggest win in 21 years against Mallorca by the score of 7-0 (footnote: Mallorca had experienced a meteoric rise starting from the 4th division in 1980 under Llorenc Serra Ferrer). But Menotti would be gone after 8 months. That was more than his successors would manage. Former players Ufarte, Peiro and Clemente came and went. 
	
		Legendary Yugoslavian manager Tomislav Ivic took over and went on a run of just 1 defeat in 25 matches. The run was ended by, of all teams, Mallorca (who were also the team that beat them during that run). This allowed Cruyff's Barcelona to claim only the Catalan's third league title in 30 years and tenth in total (Atletico had 8 to their name)(footnote: Radomir Antic's Real Madrid were in pole position to win the title on the final matchday but lost to Tenerife). Atletico did eliminate them in the semi finals of the copa del rey, and having also eliminated Real earlier in the competition, it seemed like Atletico could walk the final. However, standing in their way were bogey team Real Mallorca. Again they proved to be a stiff test for Atletico. However, this time Atletico prevailed but only in the 2nd period of extra time.
	
	Real 2-0<br>
	Barcelona 4-3<br>


	<h5>Collateral Damage (1994)</h5>
	
	<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2vOvYb1E-R4/hqdefault.jpg">
	
	The big spending was balanced out by cost-cutting in other areas of the club deemed unprofitable. One of these areas was the academy. Raul Gonzalez Blanco, a promising 14 year old youth team striker found himself looking for a new club a year before he was eligible to sign a professional contract by Spanish law.

	Fatefully named, Raul would join "los blancos" across town, making his debut 2 years later. In just his 2nd appearance he would start against Atletico at the Bernabeu. He'd force a wrongfully called penalty, and score his first ever senior goal in a goal-laden first half that his old club would lose 4-2.


	<h5>Scorched Earth policy</h5>
	
	<img src="http://netgear.rohidekar.com:44452/e/Sridhar/Atletico%20Madrid/pictures/Other/Downward%20sprial%20(league%20performance%20history%20chart)%202.jpg">
	
	It's sometimes said in business that the only way to find winning formulas is to "try lots of stuff and keep what works". Jesus Gil would apply that strategy in the search for the coach to make his club great again. After Aragones' departure, Gil made managerial changes 10 times in a 2-and-a-half year period. 8 of the appointments were South American. They included 1994 World Cup coaches Coco Basile and Francisco Maturana (who had resigned from Colombia amid death threads before the same fate befell him as Andre Escobar).

	None of them worked, as Atleti endured their lowest league position since the 1930s.
	<h5>Yugoslav golden era (1995)</h5>

	Around the same time as Ivic had left Atletico several years earlier, his countrymen at Red Star Belgrade had won the European Cup against Jean Pierre Papin's Marseilles. Their manager Ljupko Petrović, fleeing from the first Balkan war, joined Espanyol immediately after but achieved little in Spain. Conversely, another Yugoslav manager's stock trended upwards in Spain. Radomir Antic, after a spell at Real coinciding with Ivic's at Atletico (but getting sacked by Real while top of the league), had taken the reins at Real Oviedo . He'd helped them avoid relegation, then led them to respectable 9th place finishes in 2 consecutive seasons, both times above Gil's faltering Atletico. 
	<h5>Overcoming adversity (1995)</h5>
	Antic brought in a player he'd known from his time as assistant manager at Partizan Belgrade, Milinko Pantic. They were also joined by Santi and Molina from Albacete, who'd just survived a 4th season in the top flight after facing relegation playoffs (I don't get it - they lost 5-2 to Salamanca). Molina had come through the ranks at Valencia without featuring for their senior team. Bulgarian Luboslav Penev had played for Valencia's first team for 6 seasons and amassed an impressive goal tally, but even more impressively overcame testicular cancer which prevented him taking part in Bulgaria's unlikely World Cup 94 heroics. Thus a team of fighters that could deal with pain had been summoned.

	South America may have no longer been an x-factor but it was clear that East-Mediterranean countries had become wildly successful (Italy and Yugoslavian clubs contested 8 consecutive Champions League finals, winning 5 of them) amid political turmoil, including at Atletico's expense (Parma had beaten Atletico en route to their first European trophy). Atletico wanted in, and Gil got the chequebook out to match the rich italian owners who had been throwing an obscene amount of money into football.

	Notwithstanding Yugoslav Antic's success at Atletico, his countryman Milinko Pantic had finished top goalscorer in the champions league. Simeone was tied equal in 2nd with four Juventus players. This, in addition to Juventus reaching the last 2 champions league finals caught Gil's eye. 
	
	<h5>Italian Imitation (1997)</h5>
	<img src="http://i.skyrock.net/7473/19247473/pics/545830838.jpg">
		
	Wanting to emulate Juventus' superiority to Atletico's in Europe, Gil raided the old lady for one of their quartet, offering a lucrative package to tempt him Christian Vieri away from the Serie A winners.
	
	Fed by other big signing Juninho, Vieri would record an incredible goal-to-game ratio. But Atletico would be thwarted in their quest for honors by Lazio. On the field, another Serbian Vladimir Jugovic (one of the heroes of Red Star Belgrade's European triumph) fired in a spectacular strike to deny Atletico a place in the Uefa Cup final. To make matters worse, Lazio owner Sergio Cragnotti would offer even more money to bring Vieri and his goals to the Italian capital (it worked as Lazio won the last ever Cup-Winners-Cup, with Vieri scoring in the final). In an effort to compensate, Jugovic was brought to the Calderon that summer. He would not link up with countryman Antic as Gil chose not to renew his contract. 
	
	Instead Gil entrusted the hot seat to the man who won two of the aforementioned European Cups, Arrigo Sacchi. His team would go undefeated at home in the first half of the season, and even won at the Nou Camp. However, in that match the second of Atletico's 2 biggest remaining stars, Kiko, fell victim to a long term injury joining Juninho who had struggled to return to form since his injury the previous season.
	<!-- twist : injury -->
	<h5>Running from the law</h5>
	<!-- twist : imprisonment for illegally pumping money into the club -->
	The 2nd half of the season was just one game old when Jesus Gil was jailed for embezzlement of funds from the town of Marbella to the club in the early 90s. He was released on bail, but only after being admitted to hospital while in prison for blood pressure. After some successful rallying, Sacchi suffered suddenly 3 home defeats and was sacked (and retired from full time management).
	<br>	
	It went from bad to worse as Atletico managed only one league win in 4 months, but they raised themselves for cup matches, beating the Italian's other capital team Roma home and away. They failed again at the semi final to the strongest ever assembled Parma team (whose rise from obscurity began under Sacchi) that included Buffon, Thuram, Veron, Crespo and Chiesa (they would go on to win the final just like 6 years earlier). But they edged through the domestic cup with a blistering strike from Italian defender Michele Serena (who would join Parma in the summer) to overcome a rising Deportivo La Coruna, managed by ex-Atleti player Javier Irureta.
	<br>
	On the other side of the bracket was Valencia, managed by another Italian Claudio Ranieri. His team had dumped out both Barcelona and Real Madrid scoring 14 goals in those 4 games, including a 6-0 win over Real (which softened up Real days before Atletico won their first derby in 7 years and ended their torrid league run). Atletico's mini resurgence overseen by a returning Antic was no match for Ranieri's golden generation of Mendieta, Claudio Lopez, Angulo, Farinos, Albelda and Canizares in the first ever fixture to be played at Seville's new Olympic stadium as Valencia claimed their first trophy since Mario Kempes and company won the Cup Winners Cup 19 years earlier after Graham Rix missed a sudden death spot kick. The clip of the night was Mendieta's mesmerizing chest facing away from goal, lob over the back line and finish past Molina. In a managerial merry-go-round that defied logic but not financial allure, Atletico fans looked forward to the next season with Valencia's Italian mastermind taking charge.
	<br>
	Atletico boasted promising youngsters Jose Mari, Valeron, Baraja (part of the b-team that almost won the Spanish 2nd tier league) and Solari to supply new signing Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with goalscoring chances. The Dutchman obliged, achieved great goalscoring exploits, helping Atletico to their first win at the Bernabeu since the 1992 cup final.  
	But vision and reality made poor bedfellows. The derby win was no reflection of the team's erratic form which while Gil continued to be at odds with the law. The club was put into administration days before the new millennium, some players stopped being payed, and Atletico continued to perform poorly on the field. Gil resumed control weeks after Ranieri had resigned. Antic was brought back but results got even worse. Atletico were the closer than they'd ever been since the civil war to relegation.

	Fittingly, it was Real Oviedo who put the final nail in the coffin of Atletico. And in the ultimate irony, it was Luis Aragones who oversaw it in the opposing dugout. 
	Just like in 1939 the Tartiere would not be of any use following the summer, but this time it was because Oviedo had built a new stadium. There was no war to save Atletico (footnote: the war on terror was another year from being declared with the September 11th attacks in New York). But the bizarre parallels didn't end there. Antic returned to Oviedo the following season and tasted relegation again.
	
	
	
	
	After losing the Spanish Cup final with grown men in tears, Atletico made plans for life in the 2nd division along with both Seville clubs who were also been relegated (footnote: relegation playoffs had just been abolished). At the other end of the table Deportivo had finished champions and spent their prize money on Molina, Valeron and Capdevila. Atletico also had to cash in on Hasselbaink, who fell just short of winning the pichichi. To the fans' comfort, they signed the man who beat him to it - Salva Ballesta.

	The last Italian, Giorgio Venturin was sold and thus brought an end to the great Italian experiment.
