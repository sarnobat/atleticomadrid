In this documentary we investigate how an underdog Spanish soccer club, fueled by a culture of defiance, survived in a world of heavyweights and managed to win trophies.

<!-- 1920s : Obscurity -->
At birth it was an outsider club, enjoying little success compared to its local rivals or regional capitals used as vehicles for political pride. 

<!-- 1940s-1950s: Work Ethic -->
The club began making a name for itself in the aftermath of the civil war, adopting the ethos of discipline and hard work of its military reinforcements.

<!-- 1960s: Rejects -->
Whenever available, the club opportunistically salvaged the unused assets of its neighbors
<!-- 1970s-1980s: Devotees -->
to complement the club's own stalwarts, some of whom chose belonging and identity over more illustrious legacies elsewhere.

<!-- 1990s-2000s: Fighters -->
The other ingredient in the club's successes has been a battling spirit, epitomized by several South American recruits.

This alternative path to success has been treacherous, with casualties both sides of the terrace, and has earned a reputation of notoriety and ire among purists.
