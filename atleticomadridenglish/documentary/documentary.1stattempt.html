<h3>Brief History</h3>

This is a story of a fight for the right to exist.

<h4>In the beginning</h4>
There lived a club with no individuality: no shirts, and no trophies. After the war, they were with no home and no players.<br>
<br>
Across the city was another team. That team was the firstborn and the franchise, with all the medals.<br>

<h4>Self Entitlement</h4>

The war tore the country and its football infrastructure apart, and the 2 took different paths to resurrect their place.<br>
<br>
The big team slowly but surely rebuilt their empire and were ready to resume their role as the city's flagbearers. By this point the upstarts had put themselves on the map and were forced to return the keys to the kingdom to the firstborn.<br>
<br>

<h4>Chance for Rebuttal</h4>

The firstborn were declaring supremacy across Europe parading their glorious soldiers of Di Stefano and Puskas, but the upstarts were given the stage for a moment. They had the opportunity to state where they stood in relation to the firstborn.<br>
<br>
It was a brave but ultimately unsuccessful address to the continent of their place. The firstborn not only continued to rule, but ruled with an iron fist.<br>

<h4>Enough is Enough</h4>

The upstarts would search for more modest success in the domestic cup final. However, the rulers wanted all the spoils to themselves, no matter how big or small. They were trying to erase the upstarts from existence. With their expensively built fortress chosen as the venue of battle a mere 12 months after the disappointment of Zaragoza, they held a critical advantage. 
<br>
But the upstarts were not ready to surrender. They had reacted immediately to that setback by recruiting the mastermind that had begun their opponents rule. 
<!--They had come prepared with reinforcements: 
they'd recruited their own south american personnel, acting quickly on the convenience of his talents being displayed in Sweden months after their loss in Zaragoza. --> And at the <br>
Puskas, repeated his feat from 12 months earlier of scoring in the first half. But with the brains of the enemy in the red and white dressing room at half time, the acquired inferiority complex was shed and the upstarts reemerged with galvanized intent and slayed the monster with a haul of 3 goals.
