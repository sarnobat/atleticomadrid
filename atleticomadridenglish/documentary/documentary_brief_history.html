Atletico Madrid started out as a subsidiary of Athletic Bilbao. They were never the flagship team in the capital, with Real Madrid winning the regional championship almost every year. Only on 2 occasions did Atletico outdo them, but even then they failed to go on and claim national honors after defeats to the champions of other regions. It got worse for Atletico as they lost their place in the newly created national league.
<br><br>
Then the Spanish Civil War happened. Player deaths and stadium damage would bring the entire country to its knees. But curiously this gave Atletico an edge. Rival clubs were also struggling to field competitive teams. Atletico formed an alliance with the military and, almost literally, stole a march. They were also given an opportunity to regain their place in the national league because Real Oviedo, who were meant to replace them after winning promotion, had no stadium to play in and a spot remained available to the winner of a playoff with Osasuna. After winning that, the alliance <!-- hybrid club --> won its first 2 national championships.
<br><br>
The association with the military was short-lived and other clubs had caught up. Hard work and discipline learnt from the military would no longer be sufficient, and Atletico had to sprinkle in some stardust. A friendly days after the affiliation officially ended, the new industry of air travel permitted a new pool of talent to be exposed to Spain. Argentine champions San Lorenzo were the first to dazzle the Spanish in a tour. Friendlies against foreign opposition became commonplace, and Atletico discovered the dazzling Morrocan Larbi Benbarek who played in France. Atletico captured his talent along with his manager Helenio Herrera, claiming their 3rd and 4th league titles.
<br><br>
Rivals Real Madrid embarked on a golden age, dominating the newly established European competition. The two Madrid clubs were on a collision course to decide who truly was the best. It was a tie that Atletico narrowly lost, admitting inferiority to their neighbours.
<br><br>
Atletico could have become resentful and disassociate themselves from everything associated with Real, but instead made a deal with the man who had started Real's golden era Jose Villalonga. This guerilla tactic brought instant rewards. Not only did Atletico avenge their loss to Real in their own backyard (twice), but they claimed their first european trophy too.
<br><br>
Villalonga's mastermind attracted the attention of the national federation, and he was lured away by the responsibility of bringing success at the continental level to the country - a feat he duly achieved with Spain winning the 1964 European Championship. Atletico continued to excel in cups, but did not have the money to compete with Real Madrid or Barcelona who had just moved into monster stadiums with essentially infinite revenue. Atletico's attempt to build their own modern stadium had failed midway due to lack of funds.
<br><br>
In stepped Vicente Calderon. The businessman injected his money into the club to make the new stadium a reality. His dedication to the club was shared by players like Adelardo, Calleja, Aragones and Garate who would go on to become the cornerstones of a golden generation for the club that would win 4 league titles in 12 years.
<br><br>
But they it was still tough to compete with the elite, as evidenced by a 3-0 defeat to Ajax starring a young Johan Cruyff. Unable to attract such talent (Cruyff signed for Barcelona 2 years later), Atletico went in the other direction in search of success: hardmen. This came in the form of Argentine coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo, and his countrymen Diaz and Ayala. Both these players were shown red cards in an infamous tie against Celtic. The philosophy payed dividends as Atletico reached the final, but weakened by the suspensions lost to Bayern just seconds away from winning the European Cup.
<br><br>
Rebelliousness wasn't a trait limited to the pitchside staff. As success dried up, doctor Alfonso Cabeza took ownership of the club and repeatedly got into trouble with the football federation, including in the aftermath of a controversial match against Real Zaragoza that caused Atletico's league title challenge to collapse spectacularly. Calderon returned to the club despite deteriorating health and together with Aragones, now manager, won some more cup competitions. But Calderon passed away in 1987 from a heart attack and Atletico was again looking for an owner.
<br><br>
Controversial mayor of resort town Marbella, Jesus Gil, took over the club and went to huge lengths to bring success back to Atletico. He was a man of his word, spending large amounts on players. It brought 3 cup wins during the 1990s, the last of which came the same season as they won the league title for the first time in 17 years. There was also a large turnover of players and managers, but more problematic was Gil's bans by the federation and jail times. The result was instability at the club, and administration. Players had no idea which coach they would be playing for and whether they would be paid and results suffered dramatically. After 60 years in the top flight, Atletico Madrid endured relegation again.
<br><br>
Aragones, in the midst of success elsewhere, came to Atletico's rescue securing the club promotion and nurturing a 17 year old academy graduate Fernando Torres as well as Antonio Lopez. The club, now in the hands of deceased Jesus Gil's son, again adopted strategies to what brought them success in the past. They enlisted ex-Real Madrid players Garcia Calvo, Jurado and Jose Antonio Reyes. They looked to South America for coaching inspiration with Bianchi and Aguirre. But the South Americans on the field were the final cog in the new machine: youngster Sergio Aguero, and once-derided Diego Forlan. The pair brought the good times back to Atletico through work ethic, dedication and fight as the club began playing European football for the first time in 7 years and ultimately lifted the Europa League - ending Atletico's 50 year period since their last European honors.
