= =<br><h2>Unsorted</h2><br><h3>Out of the Real world (May 8th 1999)</h3><br>By Richard Whittle<br> <br> <br><h5>What does Atletico Madrid represent in Spain and throughout the world of football?</h5><br>Madrid's other team and, to all Glasgow Celtic fans, one of the most vicious bunch of thugs ever to take the field in a European Cup tie. El Atleti have always lived under the giant shadow of Real; a pauper compared to Real's aristocracy. While Real are all style, Atletico have earned a reputation as the thought police of world football. However, times have changed and the likes of Juninho have blunted the hard edge.<br> <br><h5>Is this reputation justified?</h5><br>Atletico have had to fight for everything. Franco favoured Real who deemed them unworthy of even rival status. The club has always been on the defensive, reflected by their choice of coaches. The master of the catenacio Helenio Herrera brought the club two Liga titles. Austrian disciplinarian Max Merkel followed him, but the club's uncompromising reputation was built around Juan Carlos Lorenzo. He played for the infamous Argentinian side, Estudaintes, in the late 60's and was more than eager to emplor the same tactics in Europe. They kicked their way to the European Cup final in 1974 before falling to Bayern Munich in a replay. Lorenzo's boys had two sent off in the semi-final against the Bhoys of Celtic and a reputation was cemented.<br> <br><h5>Who kept it going?</h5><br>While the playing staff have failed to live up to the 70's hard-men, president Jesus Gil has kept the club in the headlines through fist-fights, public slanging matches and all manner of threats and outrageous proclamation.s Thirty coaches have come and gone since the mayor of Marbella took over in the mid-80s. He reduced Arrigo Sacchi to tears and early retirement, but has put his money where his mouth is and given his coaches untold financial backing. Radi Antic is a brave man though, returning for his second spell under the axe-man Gil.<br> <br><h5>How is the club financed and does the future look bright?</h5><br>Gil's millions are evident all round the club. The city of Marbella sponsors the club and one of Gil's property development offices are under the main stand. As long as Gil keeps the money coming in Atletico won't have many sleepless nights.<br> <br><h4>THE PLAYERS</h4><br><h5>Who are the club's all-time greats?</h5><br>Atletico are more famous for their coaches than players. Spain's greatest goalkeeper and national hero, Ricardo Zamora, led the team to two titles in the early 40s and Helenio Herrera did the same 10 years later. However, it is Vicente Calderon who deserves the greatest credit. The late president fought a constant battle to keep the club afloat while Real ruled the world. More recently, anyone from the title-winning team of 1996 is hailed as a hero.<br> <br><h5>Who is the cult hero?</h5><br>Long-term injury victim Kiko in the many the team misses more than any other. The striker led the scoring charts when the club won the title in '96 and until his ankles gave out this season he was still the fans' favourite. Christian Vieri nearly won that honour, but when he quit the club for Lazio his name became dirt.<br> <br><h5>Who is the current crowd favourite?</h5><br>In a team of international stars it is the young Spanish striker Jose Mari who gets the fans to their feet. His perfect balance, quick feet and incisive dribbling have drawn comparisons to Michael Laudrup. Roberto, who can play either on the right of midfield or up front, is another rising star. Juninho will always be a favourite and is finally returning to his pre-injury form.<br> <br><h5>Who to throw your Tortilla at?</h5><br>With the players losing their Sacchi inhibitions the season is looking much brighter. The Italian coach dropped Juninho and left the young players out in favour of his countrymen. Temporary coach Carlos Sanchez Aguiar brought back the Brazilian, dropped the ineffective central defender Torrisi and told everyone to have a bit of fun. Now Antic has got Atletico playing enterprising football again.<br><h4>THE STADIUM</h4><br><h5>Describe the local area</h5><br>The industrial south-west of the city doesn’t have many attractions and the area around the Estadio Vicente Calderon is grim and colourless. The stadium is tucked in between the Manzanares river and a series of sweeping dual carriageways. Although the San Isidro cemetery is on one side and the local Mahou brewery on the other, the Calderon does have a faded charm of its own. The red-and-white striped façade needs a lick of paint, but the bars below the stand are real working-class shrines to the club. It may not have the glamour of the Bernabeu, but there is a down-to-earth feeling and there’s even a bar inside the ground selling Mahou beer, or course.<br> <br><h5>How do you get to the stadium?</h5><br>It’s not far from the old centre of the city and the excellent metro network takes you there in no time. Take Metro Line 5 to Piramides then head right across the large Glorieta de las Piramides roundabout. You won’t see the stadium until you are halfway down the hill, but when you do it looks like a giant circus tent.<br> <br><h5>What is the view like?</h5><br>Even with a capacity of 62,000 the all-seater Calderon feels quite compact. The steep tiers offer good views but be warned: three sides are uncovered. The covered side is called the preferente with the palco preference B being the most expensive at around 9,000 ptas. A VIP box with room for 25 seats has just been opened and there are plans for further expansion. At the other end of the scale, behind the goals in the anfiteatro de fonde norte or sur the views are still excellent and you get closer to the ultra culture. Prices start at around 3,000 ptas. The Atletico hardcore head to the fonde sur, so it’s worth going to the fonde norte to take in the choreography at the other end.<br> <br><h5>How easy is it to get a ticket?</h5><br>Unless Real or Barcelona are the visitors, there are no problems getting a ticket even on match day. The main ticket offices are at gates 8 and 68 and there are always touts who can easily e knocked down in price nearer kick-off. Remember, Liga games generally kick-off on a Sunday at five in the evening, or seven in the spring and early summer.<br> <br><h5>What have been the highlights?</h5><br>Few and far between with the last memorable back in 1996, after the Liga title was secured. Around 200,000 fans converged on the Vicente Calderon to celebrate. It was also used in the 1982 World Cup when France strutted their stuff against Northern Ireland and Austria.<br> <br><h4>THE FANS</h4><br><h5>How do Atletico fans compare with their rivals?</h5><br>Los colchoneros (the Mattress Makers) – so named after their red and white shirts originally borrowed from Athletic Bilbao – have one of the best-organized and colourful followings around. The main ultra group, El Frente Atletico (the Atletico Heads), who stand in the fonde sur, are the closest thing to Italian ultras in Spain. They sing and chant for the full 90 minutes, wave the red, white and blue flags and bash out an incessant drumbeat, backed by what seems to be native-American chanting. There is even a racoon mascot dressed in a native-American headgear who runs on before kick-off to gee everyone up.<br> <br><h5>It sounds more like an American university game?</h5><br>Not quite. They also have repertoire of cheesy 70s pop songs. They may like to sit and be entertained in the Bernabeu, but in the Calderon they want to get involved.<br> <br><h5>Are they disliked as much as Real Madrid fans?</h5><br>Just about. Atletico have a strong travelling support which has made its presence felt at away games. Like Real fans, they sing about Madrid’s regional pride which doesn’t go down well in other parts of their country.<br> <br><h5>How do they get on with their city rivals?</h5><br>Atletico draw their support from the solid working-class districts in the centre and south of the city. They are proud that the club wears the city’s emblem on their shirts. As Real think a game against Barcelona is more important, el Atleti will do anything to put one over them. Real’s exit from the Champions’ League this season caused just as frenzied celebrations as Atletico’s victory over Roma in the UEFA Cup. A derby game is still the most important to win – even if it is only for vocal and colourful support.<br> <br><h5>Do you rate their kit?</h5><br>You’ll certainly stand out in the crowd wearing the famous red-and-white shirts. The stripes on the sleeves have been replaced with faded-red that darkens towards the cuffs. The blue shorts are stylish and baggy. Of course, the mark of Gil is on the front of the shirt, but it’s still a cool kit.<br> <br><h5>What kind of media coverage do Atletico receive and how are they perceived by the media?</h5><br>It takes something like winning the Liga title or a Gil outburst for Atletico to make the front pages of the Madrid-based newspapers Marca and AS. You will have to dig back into around page 10 to find news on the club and then it is never as interesting or  as outlandish as Real’s coverage.<br><br><br><h3></h3><br>25 years of Gil family self.atletico<br>submitted 3 months ago by sierrazasAtlético de Madrid<br>Source: Colchonero.com<br>Context: This article was written in 2012 (so no Cholo, that's why some numbers vary)<br>GIL FAMILY: 25 YEARS IN THE BOX OF THE CALDERON (Now almost 30)<br>In the start of June 1987, Brian De Palma just aired “The Untouchables” for the first time, a movie ambiented in the 30s with the Dry Law in the USA, which was awarded with 4 nominations for the Oscars (Sean Connery got one for Best Actor in Supporting Role). In those days, Madonna was touring in Japan, Whitney Houston was smashing selling records in the US with her new album, and, in Spain, David Bowie managed to get to the first position in Los 40 Principales list (quite surprising considering that's a radio for mainstream music). Talking about sports, Wimbledon had a massive surprise for us when Ivan Lendl, who was at that time in a more than 2 year streak of best ATP player, lost in 3 sets against the aussie Pat Cash.<br>That same June of 1987, day 27, D. Jesus Gil was elected as the president of Atletico de Madrid. An appoinment which lead, a few years later, an endless list of judicial processes, fraud and misaproppiation accusations, faked documents, uses of club's money to his own return, inflations of the price of some players who never were professionals, of taking a club which was considered one of the 3 or 4 best teams in Spain, to lift only 6 trophies in 25 years, with a relegation included. This is the case of Gil family, joined very tight to the name of Enrique Cerezo, up front of a Sports Limited Company (SAD, Sociedad Anonima Deportiva), before a Football Club. It's the history of how a club owned by their socios ended in the hands of managers who never paid for it. It's a narration that lots of people know, but disgracefully, not everybody knows.<br>25 YEARS OF HISTORY: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FOOTBALL TEAM AND THE TRIBUNALS<br>“The socio has reacted. This is the beginning of a huge transformation, the starting of a new era”<br>                          Jesus Gil, June 27th of 1987<br>1987: JESUS GIL IS ELECTED AS THE PRESIDENT OF ATLETICO DE MADRID<br>The elections were held that 27 of June, with 4 candidates committing to it:<br>*D. Enrique Sanchez de Leon, who were a Health Minister between 1977 and 1979, during the first government of Adolfo Suarez (Spanish transition guy)<br>*D. Jesus Gil y Gil, real estate promoter. He was convicted of the collapse of a ceilling in Los Angeles de San Rafael in 1969 where 56 people died.<br>*D. Agustin Cotorruelo, son of the socio number 1, Commerce Minister during Carrero Blanco's presidency (1973, Franco still alive). He was the president of the club during 3 months in 1982 while everyone was preparing the return of Vicente Calderon.<br>*D. Salvador Santos Campano, Vicepresident of the club for more than 15 years, and ex player of the handball sections in the 70s.<br>That day, at 18:45, the results were known and with a total of 12.476 votes.<br>How could Jesus Gil win those elections when he was the one with the lesser curriculum? To answer this question, we have to travel to Portugal, to Oporto. It was there where one of the best players of that time, Paolo Futre, awarded with 2 best player award of the portuguese league, league champion 2 times, and what made him famous, european champion in that year in a thrilling final against the allmighty Bayern Munich.<br>He debuted in 1983 with Sporting CP, where he only remained one year because of a supposed raise of wages he asked for. Three seasons in Oporto and then a millionaire contract with Atletico, 4 seasons with a wage of 120 million pesetas each year (that was hell of a lot back then) and a chalet. His transfer was 500 million pesetas, the highest for a portuguese player at that time. Jesus Gil travelled himself to Portugal to close the deal and he brang Futre to Madrid, where the team played the cup final a day later of that elections. He can't play, but he had to start rentabilising the transfer and inspiring hope to the supporters was the first step.<br>Atleti lost that final, where we played in Zaragoza against Real Sociedad. Game time ended with a 2-2 score which lead the game to the penalty shootout. Then Arconada was made a hero (he was a very good keeper) and John Benjamin Toshack made history making la Real win his 2nd Copa del Rey (first one was in 1909).<br>1992: CLUB IS CONVERTED INTO A SLC<br>5 seasons after the arrival of Jesus Gil, and with 14 changes of coach in those years, October 30th of 1992 was the deadline day for clubs to convert into SAD, as said in the Sports Law of 1990. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic and Osasuna were not forced into it, since they have positive net patrimonial value at that time. This law forced the other teams in first and second division to convert into SAD so the waste of money that some presidents made should end.<br>June 28th 1992: This date is largely remembered by Atleti fans. That day Atleti won his 2nd straight Copa del Rey. If one year before the rival was Mallorca in the Santiago Bernabeu (we like winning there), with a 1-0 victory for us, that time we faced our rivals, Real Madrid, in the same scenario. We won the cup with Schuster goal from a free kick and a Futre lef footed shot.<br>At the end of this second phase of transformation, Atleti had covered only a 5% of his social capital (102 million pesetas). Facing third phase, which should be open, the board decided that only the actual socios could apply for it. Time expired 29th. After that, and depending of how much of that capital was covered, Gil would buy the rest of the club shares, club sources told. “President's idea is to give some opportunity for the socios” said those sources. We have to point that in that year the socio fee raised a solid 65% from last season, so a lot of people didn't renew his, which lead to a major decrease in the number of socios who could opt for some shares.<br>29th June 1992: As Jose Miguelez published in El Pais (sorry, i searched for the article but i couldn't find nothing :()”all the consulted club sources, except for Jesus Gil, assure that he has all the money to buy the remaining shares (1.960 million pesetas), but no official confirmation. The oposition, meanwhile, offer themselves to put the money if Gil leaves. The problem is that deadline is close and if Atletico don't meet it, they would play in the 3rd division.<br>“You all know that we have money problems. But we are going to solve it. We the poors have also the right to be happy and eat caviar” Jesus Gil, June 29th of 1992 (Again, i couldn't find a source for this. But this wikiquote is hilarious if you understand spanish)<br>In an atmosphere of euphoria after beating our long time rival, from the board were sent pesimistic messages about the financial state of the club. Social capital ascended to 2.060 million pesetas, and the socios only covered a 5%. If there were troubles finding the money, why wasn't the third phase open to everybody and they decided to made it only for the socios? Gil repeated one time and another that the club was in a very tight economic situation, although he showed himself as the hero we needed, the one who would put the money to save Atletico from the relegation to the third tier because of its debts.<br>June 30th, 1992:(El País): “All the sources asked from the club, except Gil, insist about afirming that the president has the money. But, CSD (Consejo Superior de Deportes, main sport org here) at the end of the day only had bad news. In an attitude that some people close to him feel as faked for a better ending. Gil showed himself very pessimistic about his managements. “In these moments”, he said,”i haven't solved the problem. I'm worried about Caja Madrid (now Bankia) not answering my credit demand. I think i'm paying the price of being in politics. But, anyway, i've got more solutions. We'll keep on fighting. If i don't achieve it now, i'll ask, according to the law, a temporal exception”. Yesterday, Joaquin Leguina (Comunidad de Madrid president) made for sure the conversion into SLC when meeted in the celebration of the Cup won a few days ago.”Go calmed to holidays, next year you'll carry on” he said.”<br>Marca: “For Jesus Gil is redeem. He is seeking desperately for those 2.000 millions that'll allow the conversion of his club in a SLC. To the downgrade in the sports side you should add the economic one. Atleti would be excluded of the Plan de Saneamiento (a plan made to quit club debts) so it should face its debts of 3.269 million pesetas with Seguridad Social and Hacienda and which would be made effective inmediatly.”<br>JULY 1st, 1992: 200 MILLIONS AND A DRESSING GOWN<br>Money put on each SLC<br>July 1st, 1992 (El País): “Jesus Gil, Atleti president, arrived to the CSD 10 minutes before the deadline expired. Few minutes before, club's lawyer, Jose Luis Sierra, presented in the register the deeds for the conversion. There are 3 bank certificates cited in those deeds: One of Banco Central Hispano (now Banco Santander), for 120 million pesetas, for the shares remaining. The other two were mortgages, one for 1.300 millions and the other one for 713, being Credit Lyonais and Vitoria Bank respectively.<br>”The dressing gown is made of silk, was a present of my wife, and the slippers are from Loewe” Ruiz Mateos, Rayo president at that time<br>Context of the quote<br>That photo was taken in June 20th, a few minutes after the time for teams to convert into SLC ended. There we can see Jesus Gil and Jose Maria Ruiz Mateos, Atleti and Rayo majority shareholders, respectively. What is curious about this photo is that they are the two presidents of the SLC with less socio percentage shared (Atleti 5% and Rayo 2%).<br>“Football should stop being every Sunday battle. Here we stop the tissue thing against the board. > When one shows the tissue, the other shows the actions...” Jesus Gil, July 8th 1992<br>SEASON 1999-2000: JUDICIAL INTERVENTION<br>December 22th in 1999 (Lotto day here), Manuel Garcia Castellon, Audiencia Nacional judge (one of the highest instances of law in Spain), decreed the destitution of the president, Jesus Gil, and all of the board members, and the intervention and seizure of Atletico de Madrid shares. Manuel Garcia Castellon named Luis Manuel Rubi as the judicial administrator with full powers until March 31, 2000 to take over the management of the club while the crimes were being investigated, which the prosecutors accounted to be 9.427 million pesetas.<br>April 11th, 2000 the judge dictated the end of the judicial intervention and the return of Jesus Gil as a president. As of that, Rubi left the club and the control was passed to the Gil family, although all the operations would be supervised by two inspectors who should agree certain operations.<br>As ABC said in December 23rd, 1999, and according to a deed presented by the Audiencia Nacional prosecutor, Carlos Castresana, “at the end of 1997 Jesus Gil had debts with Atleti for 2.700 millions. After that, in January 1998 Gil decided to pay off his debts with the general manager of the club, his son Miguel Angel (now in charge). But he didn't make that paying it, instead, according to the prosecutor, he loaned to his own club some players throught his company Promociones Deportivas who were assessed by him and his son for 2.740 million pesetas, when the price of those footballers should be infintely less, if not almost zero”. This case of assessing those footballers in 2.740 millions is called “Caso Negritos”, which was judged with the misaproppiation of the club of Jesus Gil and Enrique Cerezo in the “Caso Atletico”.<br>2003: CASO ATLETICO SENTENCE<br>February 14th, 2003, Audiencia Nacional condemned Jesus Gil to 3 years and a half in jail for misaproppiation and fraud, to give away to the club his 236.056 shares and to get a debt of 2.700 million pesetas of Caso Negritos. Enrique Cerezo was also condemned as a necesary cooperator for the misaproppiation (12 months of prison) and Miguel Angel Gil Marin too (fraud crime simulating contracts, 18 months of jail). The effects of these depend on the decision of the Tribunal Supremo (the highest instance i think with the Constitucional), which would arrive in middle 2004.<br>2004: FINAL DECISION OF TRIBUNAL SUPREMO<br>The sentence of the Tribunal Supremo was to absolve both Jesus Gil and Enrique Cerezo, considering that their crimes of misappropiation had prescribed. However, they mantained the condemn over Miguel Angel Gil Marin for the contract simulation, as well as the obligation to recover the financial state before the signing, when that reflected a debt of 2.700 millions of Jesus Gil with the club, being acquierd by his son Miguel Angel Gil and all other inheritors. (Jesus Gil died in May 14th of a brain stroke)<br>“They have accused us of being thieves and i say only one thing: you only can steal where you >can, and the prosecutor thought that here there would be oil (referring to a big business) and he >only found hard work” Enrique Cerezo, July 9th 2004<br>In page 36 of the sentence we can read the following:<br>“Jesus Gil got his shares in a fraudulent way, without spending any money, as it has been accredited, even the crime of misappropiation has prescribed, but Atletico de Madrid, like many others, has a story and inmaterial values, which trascend and overcome its mere economic influence. Definitely, father and son, with manifested abuse, disloyalty and preconception suscribed both of them the contract which formally had two parts, but with the club one being used for their interests and not the club's ones, so, in fact, the debt was condoned in prejudice of the club.”<br>And well, the Miguel Angel history as the club director i think we al kinda know. “Best Sports Manager of the year” according to Globe Soccer when we achieved the 2 titles and they sold almost everyone, and some shady things with Mendes and investment funds...<br><h3></h3><br><h4>[History time] How the Gil family became owners of Atleti and why many people hate them for that (part 1) </h4><br>self.atletico<br>submitted 1 year ago * by maeseCaracórner<br>Following the results of the 2nd r/atletico survey it is possible that many subscribers were left wondering about the question on the current board of directors. Why? Aren’t we doing great lately? Especially notable is the difference between respondents from the Madrid area and the rest of the world.<br>My personal opinion is that someone is doing their job really well at Atleti. Ever since Torres was sold, almost all signings have been spot-on, creating value both on the pitch and in the treasury of the club. The fan base is expanding, we have good results and reducing our huge debt. Simeone was a gift of the gods, but let’s not forget that before him Aguirre put us back in Champions League and Quique made us champions after 15 years, which is something many of us feared would never happen again.<br>I don’t think the mastermind behind this is either the president Cerezo or CEO and majority shareholder Gil Marín. However, at the very least, we need to give them credit for letting the right people do their job and not interfering with them. Someone is finally thinking long-run and our current good situation is a result of it.<br>Why can’t many people forgive them? I’m starting this series so that r/atletico knows the history of how Gil Marín’s father (Jesús Gil) became president of the fan-owned club by popular vote and then, together with Cerezo, transformed it into a private company fully owned by himself. He had tons of problems with justice, went to prison several times and the club was found to be used as a money laundering machine, which ended with a judicial administration and a relegation to Segunda División that same year. Notice that I’m not saying “allegedly” because all of this was judged and all appeals are final. That's the tl;dr if you want to stop here.<br>This is not really OC; I’m basing it on a brilliant series by the user Garate9 in the colchonero.com forum (link to the Spanish original). However, that series was aimed at a different public – people familiar with most of the names and with Spanish politics and justice system. I’m not translating directly: I’m simplifying some things, cutting some others and giving some background where I think a non-Spanish fan may need it.<br>The original series had 8 chapters and was super long. I'll try to make this one as shorter and readable as possible, but the story is still complex and I don't want to miss important details. Also, I found that there are almost no sources about this in English in the whole internet, so someone has to be the first.<br>Chapter 1. Gil becomes president<br>To understand why Gil won the 1987 election we need to think of the situation those years. Atleti was in a decadence phase after the glorious decade of the 70s. Since the early 80s, Atleti had started to sell its most prominent players in order to make ends meet and refrain from expensive signings.<br>In this context, Vicente Calderón (yes, the one after whom the stadium is named, who had been president during the best years) had to come back to put some order in 1982. Despite these financial problems, a very decent team was arranged thanks to the excellent academy we had, and a couple of good signings. That team managed to stay at the top side of the table, but was never really a challenger for the league. In fact, the 80s ended with no titles, except for the Cup of 1985.<br>Calderón’s last season (1986/87) was terrible in league, where we finished out of the top group and could not contend for the top six spots (it was the only Spanish league to ever be played with a play-off system). We made it to the Cup final, but at that moment it felt like a lottery that had just gone lucky.<br>In this atmosphere of low morale, Calderón passed away and new elections were called. Several candidates were contending, but what really made the difference was Jesús Gil’s commitment to sign Paulo Futre at his own expense. Futre was the star of Porto, who had just shocked the world in the European Cup final against Bayern with skills comparable to Maradona’s.<br>All candidates promised great things, but this one put his money where his mouth was and came forward with a binding contract with Futre. The majority of fans voted for him for this reason, and he delivered.<br>Other of his big projects were to make the club more profitable by mass sponsoring, opening luxury restaurants in the stadium or even making the Manzanares river navigable and opening boat restaurants (!?). In a way, he was a visionary of modern football.<br>But, who was Jesús Gil anyway? Let’s stop the story for a moment.<br>He was a major celebrity in Spain, but maybe you guys need some introduction. It’s difficult to describe him with words: self-made man, trashy, funny, morbidly obese, hot-headed, showman, tacky, irreverent, simple, corrupt, witty… all of them fit. But sometimes an image talks louder than words. Jesús Gil was, over all things, this guy. He was also this guy and this guy.<br>I watch this and I can’t stay mad at him. After all, he was a very funny and relatable man. He had his own TV show where he appeared giving the least appropriate life advice. He talked about his time in prison the same way you would talk about your holidays. Most importantly he was one of us. He was the exact opposite of the posh madridista stereotype. He hated Real Madrid’s guts and wouldn’t care to say it out loud. He enjoyed every minute of being Atleti’s president. He repeated constantly how he wanted to be buried in the Atleti flag he kept in his office, and he apparently was when he died in 2004 (SIDE NOTE: I say apparently because, like Elvis, there’s a myth about him faking his own death to escape justice. Everyone always considered it a legend until last year, when this video was captured. That’s Villar, president of the Spanish FA, asking Gil Marín “How’s your father doing?”, to which he replies “Fine, fine.” WHAT. THE. FUCK.)<br>He made an impressive career as a real estate developer, which earned him a big fortune and also his first spell in prison (1969-1971) when a building of his star development project collapsed due to faulty materials, killing 56.<br>Around the time he was planning the conversion of Atleti into a private company, he created his own political party, whose initials were his name: GIL (Grupo Independiente Liberal – classy as fuck). He won a majority in the town of Marbella, home of some of the most exclusive compounds in the Costa del Sol, basically by pumping money like no other local campaign had ever done. It is said that he would go to every bar in town, order a coffee, chat around with everyone, pay with a banknote of 10,000 pesetas and leave the change as a tip (coffee was ca. 100 pesetas). He was a whole new level of populism.<br>Any mayor during the golden years of the Spanish real estate bubble had chances to be corrupt. They had the power to reassign land plots for building purposes, which made their prices skyrocket. The clear confusion of interests between local governments, savings banks and real estate developers led to one of the most shameful episodes of our recent history. But Gil took it to the next stage. Marbella boomed as a center for high-end leisure and attracted all sorts of sketchy real estate investors. Among them it is said the Russian mob, who would have taken advantage of the vicinity to Gibraltar and made Marbella its headquarters in Western Europe. Corruption became the system, but since money didn’t stop coming, it was sustainable and every single layer of local government benefitted from it. In the short term, it looked like Marbella was swimming in money. He won two re-elections as mayor that way.<br>When shit hit the fan in the 2000s, the Spanish government had to dissolve the municipality and appoint external administrators for the town, because every single elected official (GIL’s and opposition) was either in prison or indicted in the largest corruption proceedings known to date in Spanish judicial history.<br>Well, now you know the man. It's important because the connection between Marbella and Atleti is a key part of the story. Let’s leave it for the next chapter.<br><h4></h4><br>[History time] How the Gil family became owners of Atleti and why many people hate them for that (part 2) self.atletico<br>submitted 1 year ago by maeseCaracórner<br>On my last post we learnt about who was Jesús Gil and how he became Atleti’s president in the first place. Today we will see how he went from president to owner. Again, credit to Garate9 of colchonero.com. This translation/adaptation is based on his work.<br>Chapter 2. Atlético’s transformation into a private company.<br>We left the story when Gil brought Futre. He went on to sign some other big names, but most of them past their prime like Goikoetxea and López Ufarte (not to miss for Armando Ufarte, Atleti legend from the 60/70s). He also fired Luis Aragonés as coach. These first years are marked by turmoil, constant changes of manager, including an uprising by the squad which ended in the sale of several important players that were very poorly replaced.<br>Some mediocre years came until 90/91, with the signings of Vizcaíno and Schuster. On that season we ended as runner-ups in league and won the Cup after eliminating Barcelona and Real Madrid. For the next year, good news: Luis Aragonés was hired as coach again.<br>Season 91/92 was the best in many years. We ended second again after fighting for the league until the very end, but most importantly, we beat Real Madrid in the Cup final at Santiago Bernabéu. This is one of the historic matches of Atlético with goals by Futre and Schuster, with Luis on the bench.<br>Gil seemed to have finally touched the right key and he was popular among the fans. It’s around this time when Gil put in place the plan he had in mind since the very beginning: transforming the club into a company and becoming owner of it.<br>Explanation: football teams had been historically organized in the legal form of “sports clubs”. A sports club has autonomy to dictate its own rules and to accept members at its will, who become owners of a proportional share of the club. The main difference between a club and a company is that clubs accept members personally and all members are strictly equal and can’t accumulate more than one share. Companies follow the capitalistic logic, where shares are tradable assets that can be exchanged for money and be accumulated.<br>In the 80s and early 90s almost all clubs in the Spanish league were highly indebted; and Atleti was no exception. It was argued that the legal form of sports clubs was inefficient by modern standards, because it diluted the responsibility and created wrong incentives. In a way it seems true; as fans we care exclusively for the sports results and tend to neglect the financial part of the game, which (it was argued) was the cause for the irresponsible indebtedness. Converting clubs into companies would solve the problem, because the owners of shares would care both for the sports part (as it is the main source of revenue) but also of the long term fiscal soundness of the entity. In principle, nothing prevented from allotting one share of the company to each member of the club, so that the property could theoretically still remain with the fan base.<br>(BTW time has proven this hypothesis wrong).<br>Gil was one of the proponents of this solution and he promoted it strongly with the help of the most famous sports pundit at the time in Spain, who was friends with him. They lobbied for it and sold it as the miracle solution for all of football’s problems. In 1990 a law was passed whereby all sports clubs playing in professional leagues (1st and 2nd division in the case of football) needed to become companies by 1992, except the ones who had positive financial results for the last 4 leagues (a taylor-made exception for guess who).<br>A special type of company was regulated for this purpose (sports company), but if you read the law, it really is fundamentally the same as any other commercial company except for a few reporting requirements, and the minimum share capital (think Eibar last year).<br>So the transformation had to start. Gil was granted authorization to skip the 1991 election because of this, although, to be honest, he would most probably have won. But here is the catch: in order to clean the balance sheets of the clubs, the new companies would have to start over with a share capital that set-off the current debt. In other words, if a club was worth 500 million, but owed other 500 million, the new company could not have a share capital of 500 million and just assume the debt; it needed to have a capital of 1000 million.<br>Given the huge debt of many clubs, the high price to pay for the same share of the company discouraged current members (socios) from buying shares of the new companies. Only a very small minority of shares were sold among the former socios, as Gil expected. With this situation, the deadline for the incorporation of the company (30 June) came close and Atleti was nearly 2,000 million pesetas short in share capital (12 mio € not counting inflation, a lot back then). This meant the disqualification to play professional football, i.e., the team that had just amazed the world with Schuster and Futre’s goals in the Cup final against Madrid at Bernabéu was going to be relegated to the third division (2ª B). This was the thrill Gil wanted to make his appearance.<br>Everybody was expecting that he would somehow manage to avert the disaster. At the very last moment, 15 minutes before midnight, Gil appeared as a savior and saved the day. It was the perfect image for him: without Gil, Atleti was doomed; Gil had saved Atleti; Gil was Atleti.<br>There are two stories about how this happened:<br>1- Gil’s “official” story: at the very last minute, he obtained a credit by putting all his personal fortune as guarantee, bought the remaining shares and saved the team (and coincidentally became its owner).<br>2- The story that the Supreme Court of Spain considered as proven in its judgment of 4 June 2004: Gil and Cerezo were co-authors of a crime of undue appropriation and took advantage of their position in the club to divert money from it and make it pay for itself (in their names).<br>What you need to understand here is that in Spanish criminal law all felonies EXPIRE. This means, if there is no prosecution started within a certain number of years, no charges can be pressed anymore. Public opinion rages often about this, but most legal professionals consider it necessary.<br>The thing is, it is not always super clear when a crime was “completed” and the clock for the expiration starts ticking, especially with financial crimes. So in this case, Gil’s defense lost in the first and second instance courts, which considered the crime not expired and went on to judge him as guilty. After appealing, the Supreme Court had a more favorable interpretation about the expiration date and released him of charges on the basis of expiry alone, but did not contradict that the facts had happened. This resulted in the odd situation of a judgment saying “well, we know this happened but we can’t punish you” (in a normal situation, courts don’t even judge the facts if they have expired, so there’s no “guilty” or “innocent” verdict).<br>So, how did he do it? We’ll let the Supreme Court speak for itself:<br>“When he first gained the presidency, Jesús Gil had decided to make the club his property. For that purpose, he tried to confuse the club’s estate with his own.” (…)<br>“With this intent, Jesús Gil, assisted by Enrique Cerezo, made Atlético de Madrid recognize debts in his favor, not previously reflected in the club’s accounts, by means of deeds signed before public notaries…”<br>To summarize, by 1992 Gil was a creditor of the club for around 2,000 mio pesetas, corresponding to federative rights for players he claims to have paid with his personal money and then assigned to the club. All of this under recognition by the club (i.e. Cerezo).<br>Gil wanted to pay for the shares of the new company by cancelling the supposed debt he had against the club, which coincidentally is around the same amount that was required for the minimum share capital. The sports authorities refuse, because with a higher debt, the necessary share capital would rise to 4,000 mio.<br>“When Jesús Gil realized that his plan to obtain the property of the new company via debt set-off was not feasible, he sought a new solution for this purpose…”<br>That new solution consisted in the club assigning Jesús Gil the federative rights of all 30 players in the team (à la third-party ownership) as a payment for the fake debt. Then, as soon as the club would be transformed into a sports company, he would re-sell them to the team for an amount equivalent to what he had to pay in exchange for the shares of the new company.<br>“This transaction was made to avoid complying with the legal requirements of the transformation of clubs into companies, both in relation to the calculation of the minimum share capital, and to the actual payment of such capital. Jesús Gil would so be immediately reimbursed of the money he paid for the shares with the re-sale of the federative rights of the players…”<br>“Since the payments had no other function than simulating the purchase of the share capital, in order to have them immediately reimbursed, Jesús Gil wrote a letter on 30 June 1992 to the bank Banco de Vitoria requesting, as president of the new company, the repayment to his own personal account of 1,300 mio in exchange for the federative rights of the players" (…)<br>Similarly, another letter was sent to Credit Lyonnais on 3 July 1992 requesting the repayment of 650 mio to Enrique Cerezo, for the same concepts (…).<br>Jesús Gil and Enrique Cerezo had signed a different agreement whereby the latter sold his recently acquired shares to the former (…). This way, Jesús Gil became owner of 95% of the shares, without him or Enrique Cerezo having executed an actual payment of either 1,300 mio or 650 mio., and thanks to the debts he had been recognized in his favor…”<br>To summarize:<br>A- Gil and Cerezo buy the shares with a loan for 2,000 million pesetas.<br>B- Gil charges Atletico de Madrid plc 2,000 million pesetas for the re-sale of its own players.<br>C- Gil and Cerezo return the 2,000 million and Gil buys Cerezo his stake, as previously agreed. He did sell him later 9% of his 95%.<br>Result: Gil becomes owner of Atlético de Madrid with money coming from the club itself. Nothing can be done now, since no one claimed against it until it was too late.<br>You might think that this trick had in fact saved Atleti. This is what many people thought and why most fans supported Gil for many many years. At the end of the day, if it's for the better and it doesn't affect the team's results, maybe it's forgivable. For the last chapter we will see that in fact Atleti's judicial history only starts there. The worst was yet to come.<br><br><h4></h4><br>[History time] The rollercoaster of the 90's. (Part 3 of the Gil saga) self.atletico<br>submitted 1 year ago by maeseCaracórner<br>On the first part of the series we learnt about how Jesús Gil became president, and on the second part how the Spanish justice considered proven that he used his position to become owner of Atleti fraudulently. My initial idea was to just write 3 episodes on the history of the legal problems of the club and only mention the sports part lightly. I decided to add an additional episode about how the team did during these years to give a bit more of context. Also we get to revisit some great moments (yay!!).<br>Again, credit to Garate9 of colchonero.com. This translation/adaptation is based on his work.<br>Chapter 3: The rollercoaster before the downfall<br>Before discussing the legal stuff, we left the story in 1992, with a remarkable Cup champion squad, two international stars (Futre and Schuster), both of Spain’s centerbacks and a great project led by Atleti legend Luis Aragonés.<br>Gil had just “saved” the team and it looked like we had someone sensible in charge, we were building a great squad and had solid project. We were back to our place. Sadly, 92/93 was a terrible year. After a great start in league and CWC, a bad streak put us behind in the table. A bad match drawn against Madrid at home tipped the scale. Luis criticized Futre’s apathy and they argued. Gil supported the coach. As a result, Futre was sold to Benfica, which proved a bad move for both Atleti and him.<br>That was the “official” story. Now I’ll give you just a taste of how Gil’s dirty businesses affected the team on the pitch: years later, when responding before justice about his corruption scandals in Marbella (the posh holiday town Gil was mayor of, remember part 1), Gil declared that “I have never taken any money from Marbella to Atlético; all the contrary. I had to sell Futre in order to pay the town’s salaries because it was broke.” That's just great.<br>In fact, they had clashing characters, but they weren't enemies. Futre himself re-hired Aragonés as a coach when he was sports director in the 2000s, and when asked about their bad relationship in the past he answered that his signing for Benfica had nothing to do with Luis and, as far as he knew, it was caused by financial problems. He even dedicated him a very touching obituary (Spanish only, sorry).<br>Well, Luis resigned after another terrible match against Barça and Schuster saw the panorama and left as soon as he could. Another great project in ruins.<br>Some terrible signings followed the next few years and again, chronic instability. In 93/94 we had six different coaches. In 94/95 we had Maturana, the successful Colombian coach who impressed the world in the USA World Cup. He asked for Klinsmann and the German was willing to sign, but then Gil said that his alleged homosexuality could be a problem in the dressing room. Well, he said it with different, blunter words.<br>Those two seasons we were really close of playing the relegation play-off (4 points and 1 point), and were only saved in the last few weeks.<br>95/96. Our new coach Radomir Antic came to this desolation. The signings that year were unimpressive. Molina and Santi, from the almost relegated Albacete. Penev, discarded from Valencia and coming out of an illness. Pantic, a complete unknown Serbian, personal request from Antic. Biagini, Correa, Roberto, promising but untested.<br>Well, these questionable signings, together with the guys who had been struggling to avoid relegation for two years, would end up forming the line-up every single colchonero (old enough) can recite by heart: Molina, Toni, Geli, Solozábal, Santi, Vizcaíno, Caminero, Simeone, Pantic, Kiko, Penev.<br>For the first half of the season we were a machine, with the “advantage” of not playing in Europe, we seemed like safe champions by February. Then the important Cup fixtures started, including a legendary match against Valencia, and fatigue started to take its toll (the XI above almost never changed). Add to this that that year the league featured 22 teams and lasted 42 weeks (Celta and Sevilla were supposed to be relegated for administrative reasons but the FA backed off last minute). Similarly to 2014, we could have closed the deal weeks in advance, but nerves failed. Week 41 we draw against Tenerife. Aguilera, rojiblanco at heart, missed a clear chance that would have complicated things enormously. Last match against the weak Albacete. We needed a victory and we didn’t miss this time. Extasis.<br>As for the Cup, we had eliminated fierce opposition towards the final against Barcelona. That match was extremely hard, went on to extra time and was decided by Pantic’s only header goal in his whole career. What a way of winning a final! A goal by the undisputed MVP of the season, unknown to the world just a few months ago!<br>Only double in our history. Gil ordered a bust of Pantic to be sculpted in remembrance, and this bouquet of fresh flowers still appears every single match on the south-east corner in his honor, brought by this adorable lady. Don’t dare to touch it or the Calderón will be all over you.<br>The following year started full of excitement for our participation in Champions League for the first time in many years. With some reinforcements (even Ronaldo was in the pipeline but Barça intervened), the backbone of that champion squad remained. The team was not up to the expectations: we were out of the fight for the league soon and Barça eliminated us in Cup with a hysterical 5-4. In Champions League we faced Ajax, a powerhouse back then, in quarterfinals. We drew 1-1 in Amsterdam and lost to an extra time goal at home, after a missed penalty by Esnáider. It was hard at
