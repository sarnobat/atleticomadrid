=== 1960s ===
==== ====
In 1961, Atlético purchased large plot of land to the south west of Madrid, on the banks of the Rio Manzanares. Work was slow, and with the Metropolitano sold and the club suffering financially, they moved in with Real Madrid for part of the 1964-65 season. They brokered an agreement to return to the Metropolitano for one final season in 1965-66 and gave the stadium a glorious send-off by winning La Primera. Unfortunately, the new stadium was not ready in time for the start of the 1966-67, so on 18 September 1966, Atlético played their last ever game at the Metropolitano. A 0-1 defeat at the hands of Barcelona brought an end to 43 years of football at this gloriuos old stadium.
