=== Jeezus it's Jesus ===

"I'm Jesus Gil, not Jesus Christ," said Jesus Gil today as he returned to work as president of Atletico Madrid. Long-time devotees of Jesus Gil will already know he is not Jesus Christ, but for the less-enlightened here's one tell-tale way of spotting the difference: while Jesus Christ sits on the right-hand side of his father in heaven, Jesus Gil sits in his office, surrounded by two supervisors legally appointed to watch his every move.

Gil has been allowed to return to work while the judge investigating financial irregularities at Atletico decides whether to take action against him. Gil has been questioned over the alleged misuse of as much as 9,427m pesetas (roughly 34m squid). He was also imprisoned last year while investigators tried to untangle links between Atletico and Marbella - one-time club sponsors whose mayor is a certain J Gil. Oh, and last week the club were found to be effectively bankrupt with debts of over Â£50m.

So what the club really needs is a steady hand in the till, sorry, on the tiller. And surely nobody can have a steadier hand than Jesus. The returning chairman's first trick will be to keep Atletico in the Primera Liga standing as they are in 19th position, four points away from 17th, and with only six games to play. It will be a sizeable achievement if Jesus pulls it off. And if coach Raddy Antic is still in a job come July, why, that'll be a miracle.
