There is a brewery alongside the Calderón; Atlético couldn't organise the proverbial drinks there. Under Jesús Gil, they ditched the youth system because he did not see the point. Among the first to seek a new home was a 13-year-old by the name of Raúl. Atlético went through 37 coaches in 16 years. Ron Atkinson lasted 94 days and joked that he deserved a testimonial. Gil's successor, Enrique Cerezo, went through eight in seven years. Since 1996, with Gil's son Miguel Angel Gil Marín as chief executive, they have had 18 coaches. Meanwhile, the debt tops €300m (£263m).
