On the back of two further back to back title wins, Atlético finally purchased the Metropolitano on 15 April 1950 and immediately set about improving the facilities. The architect for the work was club president and former player, Javier Barroso. The first phase saw the terracing extended around to the west end and new changing facilities were built beneath.

Then in the summer of 1954, the club took the audacious decision to excavate the pitch and add another ring of seating where the greyhound/athletics track had stood. This increased the official capacity to 58,000, but despite the refurbishment, the Estadio Metropolitano was soon lagging behind the newer, larger stadiums that Real Madrid and Barcelona built.

In 1959 Atlético reached the European Cup semi-final against Real. They would have won on away goals, but there was no such rule and they lost a play-off in Zaragoza with a debated goal – debated at the Calderón, anyway. "That European Cup should have been red-and-white," laments one Atlético fan. "History would have changed."
