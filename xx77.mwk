=== 1940s ===
==== ====
The Civil War hit Athletic hard. Only six playing staff returned after the hostilities and the club had debts of over 1 million pesetas. To add to their woes, both the Campo de Vallecas and the Metropolitano had been destroyed during the fighting. Drastic times call for drastic measures and in October 1939 the club merged with the air-force backed Aviación Nacional, to form Athletic-Aviación Club.
==== ====
Oviedo's inability to compete in the 39-40 season threw the club a lifeline, and the Federation arranged a play-off between Athletic-Aviación and Osasuna for a place in that season's first division. Athletic-Aviación won the tie 3-1 and started the 39-40 season back at Real Madrid's Estadio Chamartin. Under the stewardship of the great Ricardo Zamora, Athletic-Aviación incredibly edged out Sevilla to earn a first ever league title. The club retained the title in 40-41 and during the summer, was forced to change to the Spanish version of their name, becoming Atlético-Aviación. During this period, work was under way on rebuilding the damaged Metropolitano. This included a new main stand, new terracing at the east end and for the first time, a substantial terrace on the north side of the ground. The Metropolitano was re-inaugurated on 21 February 1943 with a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid.
