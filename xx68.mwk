=== Jose Mari Romero ===

 AC Milan	AC Milan	
Born in Seville, Jose Mari Romero Payon rose among the youngsters of his local club. He made his debut in the league when he was only 18 and in 21 appearances for Seville he scored seven goals and was an instant hero. Six months later he left for Atletico Madrid. At Atletico he immediately made an impression and was a first team player from the very beginning. Nine goals in his first season and seven in his second, as well some impressive performances in the UEFA Cup - including a goal against Roma - and a hat-trick in the Spanish Cup against Espanyol attratced him to clubs from all over Europe. 

His natural talent and speed make him an outstanding forward. Claudio Ranieri, his last manager at Atletico, said: "He's a real natural force and has a great physique. He knows how to find space and is strong both on and off the ball. He has to learn how to be calmer in front of goal and then he would be a complete player." 

And what does Jose Mari think about himself: "My best quality is being modest, but i have a very short temper, which can cause problems. Since i was a child i hated school. My hobby was running on the beach. My idol is Marco Van Basten. I like movies, Julia Roberts and Mel Gibson. I drink lots of Coca-Cola and love egg and chips. I'm a very religious person and i always thank God for the way He treats me."
