=== THE BURNT BRIDGES, MOMENTS OF CLASS AND QUIET LEADERSHIP OF ANTOINE GRIEZMANN ===
Features

09/06/2021 by BILLY MUNDAY

There were 11 minutes of extra time remaining when Eder scored for Portugal. The unheralded striker, then on the books of Swansea, was suddenly the attention of the world, streaming across the pitch before he was engulfed by a jubilant Portuguese bench. On his way over, fists clenched in celebration, Eder and his trail of teammates passed Antoine Griezmann, who gazed forlornly towards his own goal, hands on hips.

Like in the previous rounds of Euro 2016, this was supposed to be his moment – France’s time. The country had been through so much in the months prior, with the Stade de France itself one of the scenes of terrorist attacks in Paris the previous November. Griezmann’s sister, Maud, was in the Bataclan theatre that night and thankfully survived the ordeal. Lassana Diarra, who, like Griezmann, played in a friendly against Germany that evening, later received the news that his cousin had been one of the 130 innocent civilians killed.

The resilience of France and its people was on display just days after the attacks, with their football team taking to the field at Wembley in a friendly against England in which Griezmann and Diarra featured. Both players were included in France’s squad for a home European Championship, made all the more poignant by the devastation that had come before. “It was our duty to win the matches and try and entertain the French public, to spread some happiness and try and go all the way in this tournament,” Griezmann said en route to the final in Paris.

At the end of May, his focus had not been on France at all. It was his goal in the semi-finals against Bayern Munich that had sent Atletico Madrid through to their second Champions League final in three years – and his first. The final, a tale of two missed penalties, one of which was Griezmann’s, went Real Madrid’s way once again.

Yet this heartbreak was confined to the red and white corners of the Spanish capital, with the game having been forgotten by the time Griezmann joined up with Didier Deschamps and the French squad a matter of days later.

After starting the tournament’s curtain-raiser, a 2-1 win over Romania, Griezmann was dropped for the second group game against Albania at the Stade Velodrome. “I am managing him,” Deschamps argued, yet he was also managing a host nation, and his hand forced to send on the attacker in the second half with the game deadlocked. Griezmann’s header in stoppage time saved the day. The noise under the new roof in Marseille almost took it off.

Although progression was virtually assured, Deschamps did not dare again leave out a player who was transforming into his talisman. Griezmann started against Switzerland, with a draw enough to ensure France went through as group winners. Then came Ireland, with their green belt of supporters singing loud and proud in Lyon for their moment in the sun against the hosts in the last 16. Robbie Brady’s second-minute penalty had them dreaming.

It was clear there was something not quite right about France. N’Golo Kanté’s exploits with Leicester in the season just gone had prompted Deschamps to shoehorn him into his side, although he persisted with Blaise Matuidi and Paul Pogba in a three-man midfield. Kingsley Coman’s arrival at half-time, replacing Kanté, made their play more fluid. Griezmann, playing in a floating role behind Olivier Giroud, was much more dangerous.

While Ireland’s defenders couldn’t pick him up, Bacary Sagna had no problem finding him with a cross that was thumped past Darren Randolph. Griezmann, perhaps inspired by Atletico’s Kiko or Fernando Torres, fed off the atmosphere and launched himself towards the touchline, arms outstretched as he skidded across the turf on his knees. The celebration everyone remembers, though, came after his second goal minutes later.

With Ireland preoccupied by Giroud’s physical presence, Griezmann found space around the D. Adil Rami’s searching pass was nodded into his path by France’s dashing target man, leaving the number 7 to slide the ball into the corner of the net. Out came the Drake tribute act, replicated on the football pitches and playgrounds of Europe as some sort of crazed marketing campaign. Iceland were spared a rendition of hotline bling in the quarter-finals – not that this was any consolation. Or maybe it was.

Hannes Halldórsson’s defence had been breached three times already by the time Griezmann stole in to dink him in the latter stages of the first half at the Stade de France. On this rainy occasion, a belly slide on the turf was the only way to celebrate. As his teammates made their way back to the centre circle for the fourth time, Griezmann paused, allowing Dimitri Payet to shine and kiss his boots. A global audience now at his feet, the Atletico man took centre stage for sure in the last four.

Germany are familiar opponents to any Frenchman and, even in his relative inexperience of major international tournaments, Griezmann knew the test that lay in wait in Marseille. His only other summer with the French senior team had been ended by Joachim Low’s side. Mats Hummels’ header had sent Les Bleus home from Brazil, not able to nudge their way past the eventual world champions at the Maracanã. The enduring image of that World Cup defeat were the tears of France’s number 11 beneath his floppy fringe.

Then 23, it was not lost on the French press that Griezmann could have played against them in that knockout encounter. Antoine’s father, Alain, is of German descent, hence the Germanic surname. That might explain why he was so cool from the spot when France were awarded a penalty in the semi-final of Euro 2016; not even the unflappable Manuel Neuer was able to win the battle of wits.

Griezmann had also given the Bayern goalkeeper the eyes in the last four of the Champions League just weeks before. At least this was some sort of revenge for Neuer’s heroics in Rio two years prior.

France’s second, prodded in by Griezmann’s big toe, punched their return ticket to Paris, where Portugal were waiting in the final. Then come the flashbacks, like a series of images on a reel of nightmarish film roll. The injury to Cristiano Ronaldo, the six-yard header that Griezmann inexplicably put wide, Eder’s shot and the Portuguese ecstasy. There were tears again and familiar tales of what could have been. For Griezmann, they were personal. His second-half chance was one to be rued.

The whole of France was not sullen, though. A great portion of the population, almost two million, have Portuguese heritage. They include Griezmann, whose grandfather Amaro Lopes was Portuguese. Amaro was also a footballer, playing for Pacos de Ferreira. His daughter, Antoine’s mother Isabelle, was born in France after the family had emigrated from Portugal. Antoine often spent his summer holidays in Pacos de Ferreira, too. In fact, he almost played for Portugal.

Having starred at a couple of youth tournaments with France, Griezmann and four of his under-21 teammates were reprimanded for a late night out before training. Griezmann was handed a one-year ban from international duty, enough to see him consider a switch of allegiance to Portugal, as the reports go. Fortunately for France, he stuck it out, earning a senior call-up for his performances for Real Sociedad a couple of years later.

There is always an air of curiosity surrounding a French international who has never actually played club football in France. As a youngster, Real Sociedad took a gamble on him when the likes of Paris Saint-Germain didn’t. At the age of 14, he crossed the border into Spain and never returned. “France gave birth to me, but Spain adopted me,” Griezmann would say a decade-and-a-half further down the line.

A stellar season at Anoeta ahead of the 2014 World Cup had seen Atletico Madrid come knocking. In the lead-up to the 2018 World Cup, it was Barcelona who showed interest. Griezmann, never opposed to the media spotlight, fuelled a transfer saga that many thought would distract and detract from his displays in Russia that summer. After all, he had scheduled a programme documenting his decision for a slot on Spanish TV following the opening game between Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Half an hour of dramatic pondering and pandering to the cameras, Griezmann announced that he would stay at Atletico. Perhaps fortunately for him, his headlines had already been engulfed by the Spanish federation’s own decision, sacking head coach Julen Lopetegui on the eve of the tournament. After Spain and Portugal had done battle in Sochi on the Friday night, it was France’s turn to make their summer debuts.

Deschamps’ team were the favourites for many, largely due to the sizeable talent within the squad. In the early kick-off in Kazan, they appeared to be feeling the pressure. Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele and Kylian Mbappé made up France’s front three on the teamsheet but not much else. A disjointed outing was aided by the first penalty awarded by VAR at a World Cup, with Griezmann dusting himself off after being fouled to convert the spot-kick.

Pogba’s deflected effort was enough to down Australia, while Mbappé’s tap-in in Ekaterinburg sealed another three points against Peru. This time, Giroud led the line, leaving Griezmann to glide around in behind. Mbappé was unleashed on the right wing, while Matuidi offered a more conversative contribution on the other flank. At last, Deschamps had come across a system that worked for Pogba and Kanté, too.

A disorganised Argentina, still reeling from nearly crashing out in an apocalyptic group-stage exit, waited in the last 16. Amid the chaos in Jorge Sampaoli’s dugout and the cacophony of noise created by those Albiceleste colours in the stands at the Luzhniki in Moscow, France were given a run for their money. Griezmann’s second goal of the tournament, this time accompanied by another trendy celebration, was served up from the penalty spot to kick start a crazy afternoon where the lead was tossed between the two nations like a hot Russian potato.

Mbappé’s second-half showing was sensational enough to set up a meeting with Uruguay in quarter-final, as Griezmann confronted another country close to his heart. Having bonded with the Uruguayan corner of the Atletico dressing room, the French native had immersed himself totally in their culture. Diego Godín is his youngest daughter’s godfather. “It’s a nationality that I love, a country that I love and it’s going to be very emotional for me,” Griezmann gushed in the days before.

Luis Suárez was having none of it. “As much as he says he’s half-Uruguayan, he’s French,” the striker snapped. “I do not know what’s going on in his head.” Whether he wanted to or not, Griezmann had a hand in sending Suárez and Uruguay packing.

It was his free-kick that was glanced in by Raphael Varane for the first goal and his shot that was spilled by Fernando Muslera for the second. There was no celebration, just a respectful bowing of the head. After the tournament, Griezmann was invited to visit the country by the Uruguayan president.

And just like that, France had cleared the hurdle that had halted them in Brazil. Their progression in the semi-finals was rather stealthy, too, not pulling up any trees with their 1-0 victory over Belgium but getting on the nerves of one lanky goalkeeper. “France are an anti-footballed team,” Thibaut Courtois huffed. Yet, despite their enormous attacking potential, France’s players had bought into Deschamps’ more pragmatic approach.

“I don’t care how, I want a second star to be on this shirt,” Griezmann responded having whipped in the corner for Samuel Umtiti’s winning goal. There were certainly multiple stars on show in the final, where perhaps the pivotal moment came before half-time. France and Croatia were level after Griezmann’s deflected free-kick and Ivan Perišić’s fizzing finish, with both players involved in the controversial moment.

Having strode over to the pitchside monitor, referee Nestor Pitana waved his bulky arm in the direction of the penalty spot, adjudging Perišić to have handled Griezmann’s corner at the near post. The responsibility fell on the shoulders of the self-proclaimed half-Uruguayan born in France to parents of German and Portuguese descent. If this wasn’t France’s moment, it was Griezmann’s.

With everyone else’s on him, the 27-year-old only had eyes for the ball. Like Mat Ryan and Franco Armani before him, Danijel Subasić was no match for his opponent when the football pitch was reduced to the 12 yards of grass between them.

With the advantage once more, the French players followed their number 7 to the corner flag. With the captain’s armband back with Hugo Lloris in goal, there was an element of leadership about Griezmann, guiding the team in the most crucial moments. Perhaps his great skill was not with a football but with the ability to connect with every member of the squad. Watching the celebrations in Paris afterwards, Griezmann was at the centre of most, the poster boy of a second World Cup triumph.

Struggles have followed since, though. Bridges have been burnt and rebuilt in Spain and now, loved neither at Atletico nor Barcelona, Euro 2020 offers an opportunity to become a figurehead of his country once more. There will be familiar opponents in the group stage in Germany and Portugal and, if France are to progress through the tournament to reach their third final in succession, you just know that Griezmann will be at the heart of it.
=== ATLÉTICO MADRID’S ICONIC CLASS OF ’96: THE UNLIKELY DOUBLE WINNERS WHO FORGED A UNIQUE LEGACY ===
04/02/2019 by MARK SOCHON

In terms of raw success, Atlético Madrid are still deep in the midst of a transformative, golden age that has seen the club move home and emerge as a genuine European power. However, to trace its origins and perhaps even understand its ethos, you have to go back to the mid-1990s and a crazy, logic-defying season when history was made on the banks of the Manzanares.

By winning a domestic double, the class of 1995/96 did something no other Atléti side had managed before or has replicated since. However, this was a tale of one remarkable season rather than the start of anything more sustained, and that first league title in 19 years was followed by an 18-year wait for another. It was a squad that would break up almost as quickly as it was assembled and one whose legacy wouldn’t truly be understood until Diego Simeone, an inspirational figure in the double-winning team, returned to unify a troubled club in late 2011.

The situation Simeone inherited then wasn’t quite as fraught with potential problems as the one picked up by Radomir Antić in the summer of 1995. Even the Yugoslav must’ve doubted his reign would last very long. He would, after all, be working for club president Jesús Gil, a man who, aside from his extreme right-wing politics, criminal past and all-round gangster persona, was best known for firing football coaches.

Antić was the 16th Atléti coaching appointment of a decade that had barely passed the halfway mark. The previous season had seen Gil hire and fire three more coaches as Los Rojiblancos finished just a point above what was then the relegation playoff places.

Even in a more open era than the one that exists in Spain today, Atlético Madrid that summer were devoid of any of the foundations you might expect to see from a club that was on the cusp of their best ever season. Gil was dividing his time between his other role as the Mayor of Marbella, a resort town that had come to symbolise the so-called Costa del Crime and one that would don the shirts of Atlético Madrid during the 1995/96 campaign.

Among the most controversial decisions during his long tenure at the Vicente Calderón was the closure of the club’s youth academy three years earlier, meaning the only likely way to turn recent struggles around was a radical squad overhaul.

Atléti wasted little time and would make a series of inspired signings that summer. Goalkeeper José Molina and young centre-back Santi Denia both joined from Albacete and immediately claimed starting roles. Antić also signed compatriot Milinko Pantić, a creative midfielder who would prove another instant hit, while imposing Bulgarian striker Lyuboslav Penev was bought from Valencia to add firepower and physical presence up front.

The new arrivals added to an increased sense of optimism that would only grow as Atléti impressed in pre-season. The passion in the packed stands of the Vicente Calderón was plain for all to see as Antić’s newly-assembled side beat Newell’s Old Boys of Argentina in a friendly a week before the first league game. Perhaps there was a sense even then that Atléti were going to be in for a much improved season, but nobody present that day could’ve seriously anticipated what was to come.

Even before a ball was kicked in anger, there were signs that the 1995/96 Primera División season would be a strange one. For starters it would feature 22 teams as opposed to the usual 20 after Sevilla and Celta Vigo were reinstated, having initially been relegated to the Segunda B due to a failure to make payments to the Spanish Football Federation. That meant a league that didn’t start until September had to squeeze four extra match-days into a season that was already due to finish relatively early due to Euro 96. The season would also be the first in Spain to feature three points for a win.

Atlético Madrid would be quick to reap the benefits of that particular alteration. Despite conceding early on the opening match-day with Russian international Valeri Karpin giving Real Sociedad the lead at the Calderón, Atléti fought back to ultimately cruise to a 4-1 win. The goals that day were very much a sign of things to come. A Pantić free-kick levelled the scoreline before fellow new-boy Penev bagged a brace with a penalty and a close-range finish. Simeone completed the scoring, getting on the end of a fine set-piece delivery, the first of 12 league goals the Argentine would score that season.

Penev would add four more goals in Atléti’s next three games, all of which they won to assume top spot. Those wins also produced three clean sheets and clear signs that Antić was already getting it right at both ends of the pitch as new signing Santi quickly formed a partnership with the more established Roberto Solozábal in the heart of the defence.

Nine games in, Atléti had chalked up eight wins and conceded just two goals, a remarkable transformation from their brush with relegation the previous year. However, Barcelona had also started brightly and were just two points behind Atléti after a series of convincing victories that saw them emerge as the clear favourites to win LaLiga for the fifth time in six years under Johan Cruyff.

It would take until mid-November for Atlético to suffer their first real setback. It was one inflicted by a familiar figure and by all-too-familiar foes. The decision to close the academy in 1992 had led to a promising young striker by the name of Raúl crossing the Spanish capital to join the youth ranks at city rivals Real Madrid. Atléti had already got a taste of what they had let go, with Raúl popping up to score his first ever senior goal for Los Blancos in a Madrid derby the previous year. Still just 18, the forward repeated the trick on matchday 13 of the 1995/96 season as Atléti suffered their first defeat in the form of a 1-0 loss at the Bernabéu.

Inevitably the result cast doubt on Atléti’s credentials. It was their first match against a side genuinely expected to challenge for the title and there remained an assumption, outside of the club at least, that Atléti’s bright start would prove unsustainable in the long run. This, after all, was a team of no real big names, trying to mix it with a star-studded Barcelona side as well as an increasingly impressive Valencia outfit that could count on the talents of young starlet Gaizka Mendieta and predatory striker Predrag Mijatović.

By the end of 1995, though, LaLiga’s other major forces had little choice but to take Atléti seriously, with Los Colchoneros finding the solution to just about every major obstacle that was thrown at them in December. The month served up back-to-back fixtures against Barça and Valencia and saw Antić’s men claim maximum points.

A performance of passion and purpose helped them see off Barcelona 3-1 on one of those noisy Calderón nights where the opposition found Atléti’s intensity difficult to match. The trip to the Mestalla a week later was an altogether scrappier affair but once again the side from the capital showed their character to prevail. With both sides reduced to ten men, Atléti netted the game’s only goal in the 88th minute courtesy of midfielder José Luis Caminero’s decisive close-range finish.

If they didn’t before, Atléti now had genuine reason to believe that this had the potential to be a truly special season. Those victories formed the start of a five-game winning streak as Los Rojiblancos reached the midway point in a commanding position with a seven-point advantage at the top of the Primera División. Remarkably it was not Barcelona, Valencia or defending champions Real Madrid but Sociedad Deportiva Compostela, a club that had been in the fourth tier just six years earlier and would fold a decade later, that were their closest challengers at the midway stage.

One of the key ingredients in Atléti’s early season success had been the ability of the diligent Antić to quickly settle on a system and team that was capable of competing with the best that Spanish football had to offer at the time. Under ordinary circumstances, a new coach and a much-changed squad would need time to gel but from day one, Antić appeared to find the right solution in every position and he rarely wavered from his preferred starting line-up.

While goalkeeper José Molina was the only man to not miss a minute in LaLiga, every member of Atléti’s most common 11 made 34 or more league starts that season, something that would be almost inconceivable today. The back-four provided the foundations for a side that would end the campaign with the division’s best defensive record. It featured Delfí Geli, another recent signing from Albacete, at right-back, while Toni, one of Atléti’s longer-serving players, was the preferred left-back. Santi and Solozábal were in the middle.

Antić generally opted for a diamond in midfield with Juan Vizcaíno in the holding role and Simeone and Caminero playing behind Pantić, the team’s creator in chief. Penev’s strike partner was Kiko, along with Pantić the most technically gifted player in what was sometimes unfairly dubbed little more than a workmanlike side.

Unquestionably, though, this was a side that prided itself on its battling qualities and it was one that would at times overstep the mark. Even Kiko would accumulate three red cards by the time the season was out, while his teammates would ensure the squad tally was 11 sendings off in all competitions. If there was one player who truly embodied the team’s core characteristics, it was Simeone, who picked up no fewer than 18 bookings.



Order  |  Spain

With a ten-point advantage over Barcelona and a huge 16 on Real Madrid despite the derby defeat, there was suddenly a pressure and perhaps even an expectancy that Atléti would go on to seal the title heading into the second half of the season. In an expanded 22-team league, there was still plenty of football to be played and Los Rojiblancos would need all of their mental and physical toughness to finish the job.

An ability to bounce back from adversity was perhaps the key trait as they successfully kept their challenge on track. They responded to defeat at Real Sociedad on matchday 22 with back-to-back wins. Their next defeat, a first home loss of the season against Sevilla in February, was immediately followed up by four straight victories, including a couple of fine performances in the Copa del Rey as hopes of an improbable double started to gain traction.

The second of those cup wins featured what was Atléti’s best 45 minutes of the season. Back at the Mestalla for the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final with Valencia, Antić’s men found themselves 2-0 down at the break, with Los Che threatening to put the tie to bed before it had really even got going. However, Atléti’s second-half showing that night demonstrated how this was a team blessed with style as well as substance.

A couple of sublime Pantić goals levelled the scores at 2-2 before Antić’s reputation as the man with the Midas touch reached new heights. The Atléti boss made three substitutions and each one responded by coming off the bench to score as the visitors forced the Valencia crowd into stunned silence as they turned a 2-0 deficit into a 5-2 advantage thanks to some devastating counter-attacking football. Despite a late goal from Mijatović and a second leg defeat, Atlético progressed to the final and a clash with Barcelona in Zaragoza.

There were seven league games to squeeze in before then, though, during a colourful period in the season when 1990s Spain once again proved itself to be something of a footballing equivalent of the Wild West. With Jesús Gil as club president, things were rarely quiet off the pitch at Atlético.

The bulky figure of Penev provided the first of them. In the aftermath of the Copa del Rey win at the Mestalla, the Bulgarian climbed up to the directors’ box to confront and ultimately punch Francisco Roig, the Valencia club president. Penev was reportedly unhappy at the way the club had managed his departure for Atléti the previous summer with the end of his time at Valencia coinciding with a battle against testicular cancer. Roig, who had only a few weeks earlier been the victim of an attack by Real Madrid ultras at the Bernabéu, was left needing treatment again for facial injuries.

The incident at the Mestalla was humorously condemned by all-round nice guy Jesús Gil, but it was only a matter of weeks before the Atléti president was again making headlines and throwing punches of his own. In a confrontation captured in its entirety by TV cameras outside the league’s offices in Madrid, where senior figures from Primera División clubs were meeting, Gil launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant against Compostela president José María Caneda.



Read  |  Jesús Gil and the story of Spanish football’s own Donald Trump

The latter had been quoted as making disparaging remarks about the voters of Marbella, where Gil had recently been re-elected as mayor and was clearly in no mood to back down as the 62-year-old Atléti chief hurled insults at him. Despite efforts to separate the two, Gil finally cracked and connected with a right fist to the side of Caneda’s head. There were numerous TV crews on the scene by this point ensuring one of the 1995/96 season’s most infamous moments was captured from several angles.

Just two days later, coincidentally or otherwise, Atlético suffered a shock home defeat against relegation-threatened Real Valladolid; by far their worst result of the campaign to date. As was their style, they bounced back well with seven points from their next three matches but it was still a period in the season when a few cracks were starting to show.

A particularly feisty Madrid derby followed, in which both Simeone and Fernando Hierro saw red as Los Blancos won 2-1 at the Vicente Calderón to put another dent in their city rivals’ surprise title challenge. A draw at Oviedo the following week ensured Atléti’s advantage at the top of LaLiga had been cut to just three points heading into the Copa del Rey final against in-form Barcelona.

Antić’s side had won just two of their last eight matches in all competitions heading into a fixture that felt almost bigger than a cup final, with the two sides desperate to land a huge mental blow on their main rivals for the Primera División crown. The momentum was clearly with Barça, the dominant force in Spain throughout the early 1990s and they lined up for the showpiece at La Romareda with a side possessing the talents of Gheorghe Hagi, Luís Figo and Pep Guardiola.

Atlético Madrid again fielded what had become their familiar first-choice side but this was a club that had almost come to be defined by their ability to fail when on the very cusp of glory, a narrative that seemed perfectly set up heading into the game.

Zaragoza, halfway between Madrid and Barcelona and the city where Radomir Antić had made his name in Spain as both a player and coach, was the perfect setting. The Atléti boss was now eight years into his coaching career, which included a season at Real Madrid, but was yet to win a trophy. Despite that, this was a side packed with character and one that managed to stifle Barcelona’s attacking talent as the 1996 Copa del Rey final developed into a cagey affair.

A tense 90 minutes between the top two teams in LaLiga produced few clear chances with Kiko the most probing of the Atléti players. Barça, perhaps wary of the heavy defeat they’d suffered at the Vicente Calderón, struggled to exert anything like their usual control on the game. As the final headed into extra-time and the clock ticked past 100 minutes without a goal, the prospect of penalties loomed large.

However, in the closing moments of the first period of extra-time, Atléti broke clear down the right with full-back Toni. His near-post delivery was perfect for the arrival of Pantić and the midfielder glanced his header past Carles Busquets in the Barça goal before removing his shirt and sprinting up the touchline to celebrate with the jubilant Atlético fans at the other end of La Romareda. It was a goal that Barcelona never fully recovered from, either in the game or the season, their last under the stewardship of Cruyff.

Atléti celebrated the cup win in style, with joyous scenes in the dressing room after the game including the sizeable frame of Gil, soaked in champagne, bouncing up and down with his victorious players. Antić, as was generally his way, was more measured in his reaction despite the immense satisfaction he must have got from finally getting his hands on some silverware, four years on from being dismissed by Real Madrid at a time when Los Blancos were clear at the top of LaLiga.

He now had a wonderful opportunity to complete the double with the Spanish capital’s less fashionable side. The chances of that increased ten days later as Atléti claimed a third victory of the season over Barcelona, this time going to the Camp Nou and winning 3-1. It was a game best remembered for an outrageous piece of skill from Caminero as he floored Barça defender Miguel Ángel Nadal with a turn that even Cruyff would have been proud of, before setting up Roberto for Atléti’s opening goal.

Any hope of Barcelona bouncing back from the Copa del Rey final defeat to overhaul Atléti in LaLiga evaporated into the Catalan sky on a night that effectively brought the curtain down on Cruyff’s eight-year reign. Barça would only win two of their final five games to finish a disappointing third. That wasn’t quite the end of the matter as far as Los Rojiblancos were concerned, though.

Valencia kept their title hopes alive with a 3-2 win at the Vicente Calderón on matchday 38. Coached by Luis Aragonés, a man who had won three league titles as a player with Atléti before coaching them to their most recent success in 1977, Los Che reeled off five straight victories to take the title race to the final day of the season, in part due to Atlético’s own failure to win at Tenerife on the penultimate weekend. However, barring an avalanche of Valencia goals in their fixture in Vigo, Atléti would only need a point to clinch the league title and a first domestic double.

At home to relegation-threatened Albacete in front of an expectant home crowd, Antić’s side rarely looked like they would fail to complete the job. Any nerves were eased early on when, not for the first time that season, Simeone emphatically headed home a Pantić free-kick. When Kiko added a second, capitalising on Albacete’s failure to deal with a punt upfield from Molina, the party could really get started.

There were no more goals but ultimately the result was academic as Valencia could only draw against Celta at Balaídos and, as the sun set on a clear spring evening over the Vicente Calderón, one of the biggest celebrations in the history of Spanish football got into full swing. A night that no Atléti fan who was present will ever forget inevitably spilled over to Madrid’s Fuente de Neptuno, the traditional meeting point where successes for the red and white half of the city are celebrated.

Estimates put the numbers that took to the streets that night, as the Atléti team coach crept through the Spanish capital towards Neptuno, at around 100,000, with a sea of red and white stretching the length of the city’s famous Paseo del Prado. Whether it was the sight of midfielder Juan Vizcaíno climbing to the top of the fountain’s sculptural centrepiece to hoist a replica version of the Copa del Rey or just the presence of Gil, in full gangster-mode sporting gold medallions and a tracksuit top unzipped to the waist, this unlikely success story was celebrated in a fashion that we may never see again.

It was a triumph that still today remains somewhat difficult to explain. Atléti’s doblete not only came almost completely out of the blue for a team of few stars, but was followed by a rapid decline that culminated in their relegation to the Segunda División four years later. It was a season in which they lost both Madrid derbies but still finished a huge 17 points clear of their great rivals. 

Few of those players would go on to achieve significant personal success at the club or elsewhere, at least in terms of their playing careers. Even Antić, the only man to have coached both Madrid giants and Barcelona, would fail to get close to replicating the magic of the 1995/96 season and still counts on the two trophies won at the Calderón that season as his only major honours.

Due to it being effectively a solitary season of success and because so much time would pass before Atléti rose again, the legacy of the double winning side is often overlooked. However, it’s not hard to draw parallels between that team and the one that has developed under Simeone two decades on.

From a stylistic perspective, common traits between the two eras include a solid defence, a tendency to score goals from set-pieces, and a fairly rigid 4-4-2 formation, admittedly utilising a midfield diamond under Antić. Like that side, the Atlético of the 2010s have had their fair share of individual quality, but it’s a physical and mental toughness that has helped give them an edge over their technically superior rivals.

Those were traits that were lost in the years between the subsequent break-up of Atléti’s double-winning team and the return of Simeone in 2011. From a symbolic point of view, bringing back a player who was viewed as the emotional heartbeat of that side was a clear attempt to rescue some of that identity, something that El Cholo was quick to embrace.

The link to the present day doesn’t start and end with the current boss. Five other regulars that season under Antić have all gone on to work at Atlético in some capacity. Vizcaíno is an assistant to Simeone, and both men were effectively recruited by José Luis Caminero following his return as Atlético’s sporting director in the summer of 2011. He also appointed Pantić to be Atléti’s B team boss that year meaning that entire midfield diamond would play a role in the 2011/12 campaign, which ended with a Europa League win and effectively marked the start of a new golden age for the club.

That’s why it’s too simplistic to purely trace Atlético Madrid’s reemergence as a force in Spanish and European football back to 23 December 2011, the date of Simeone’s return. While he helped give the club a sense of identity again, it was one that had been forged over 15 years earlier by Spanish football’s most unlikely double winners. For a team considered a one-season wonder, they left one hell of a legacy.

=== HOW THE UNDERRATED JAN OBLAK BECAME ONE OF THE WORLD’S LEADING GOALKEEPERS ===
08/01/2019 by CONOR SMITH

Atlético Madrid are a side known to produce, sell and profit from having a consistent stream of formidable strikers. From Fernando Torres and Sergio Agüero to Radamel Falcao and Antoine Griezmann, the Spanish side are credited with their ability to seek out and coach some of the worlds finest forwards in recent years.

What has gone slightly under the radar, though, is that the club has also produced a fine string of goalkeepers at the same time. Atlético fans have had the privilege of witnessing David de Gea and Thibaut Courtois in recent years. Now, Slovenian Jan Oblak mans the posts for Los Rojiblancos, and yet again, they find themselves with one of the best goalkeepers in the world. 

Oblak was born in Škofja Loka, the academic, economic and cultural hub of Upper Carniola, a town of just 12,000 people. By the age of 10, he was picked up by the academy of Olimpija, from his hometown club, Ločan. Troubles at national side forced them to dissolve just 18 months later, but Oblak had the opportunity to resume his progression with a newly-formed outfit, who at the time went by the name of Bežigrad, who, after several name changes, now compete as Olimpia Ljubljana. 

Oblak made his debut for Olimpia Ljubljana in the 2009/10 season at just 16 – quite the feat for a goalkeeper. The manager of the side at the time, Branko Oblak, claims he only gave his younger namesake his debut to punish his first-choice goalkeeper. “I wasn’t a visionary, I have to admit,” claims Branko.

The former Slovenia manager praised the attitude and personality of Jan, even at a young age, which has helped him develop into the world-class talent he is today. In an interview with AS, Branko describes his initial impression of the shotstopper. “He was a very relaxed kid, very serious and mature. I’m not a madman, without those attributes I wouldn’t have given a 16-year-old his debut, not even by coincidence. After his third game against Maribor, I saw that he had been the best player on the pitch and I also noticed how cool he was between the sticks. He worked like crazy and was completely focused on the idea of becoming a great ‘keeper.”

Oblak’s commitment to the cause was evident, and he’d cycle to Ljubljana and back for training every day, a total of 46km. The young ‘keeper continued to ply his trade at his local club, making 34 league appearances, before being offered a contract by Italian side Empoli in 2009.

Despite this offer, Oblak decided to take up the opportunity to travel to England and trial for Fulham in the Premier League instead. Despite the various contracts on the table, he committed his future to Olimpia Ljubljana and signed an extension until 2011.

Soon came an offer to move to Portugal, with Benfica coach Jorge Jesús calling Branko Oblak with just a single question. Benfica were confident in the ability of the then 17-year-old, but were unsure of his mentality, his maturity and ability to cope with a move to the giants and the pressures that come with it.

Branko had unwavering confidence in his young prodigy, claiming he would bet his own farm that the move would be successful for both parties. In 2010, Oblak made the move to Portugal, but barely settled in Lisbon before being loaned out to Beira-Mar for the season.

More loans followed in the Portguese leagues; Oblak spent time at Olhanense, União de Leira and Rio Ave before his chance with Benfica finally came. When first choice Artur Moraes was injured, he was given the gloves and with it an opportunity to prove his worth to the side. Six goals conceded in 24 appearances, and a 12-month stint conceding just one followed, including a performance mature beyond his years in a 2-0 win over bitter rivals Porto. Oblak had taken to the stage and made a real name for himself in European football. 



Read  |  San Iker Casillas

Nuno Esprito Santo, now the Wolves manager, was in charge of Rio Ave during Oblak’s stint at the club and was full of praise for the character and confidence that has helped the ‘keeper in his career so far: “Oblak is a goalkeeper I appreciate, because of the technical ability he has, but also due to his character. He is a ‘keeper that faces challenges in a very quiet way, without any stress or nerves, regardless of the opponent.”

Such was his impact when given a chance at Benfica, Atlético Madrid made him LaLiga’s most expensive goalkeeper at €16m in 2014, teaming up with Diego Simeone, a man who would elevate the Slovenian to new heights. Before that could happen, however, Oblak had to experience his first real lows in the game.

Failing to settle into the capital and picking up an injury in pre-season, Simeone preferred Miguel Moya as his number one initially. Opportunities were few and far between for the Slovenia international. He was awarded a start in the Champions League in his debut for the club, but an error-strewn display resulted in a 3-2 loss for Los Rojiblancos. 

Fortunately for Oblak, and for Atleti, this performance didn’t dent his confidence. When an injury to Moya in the latter stages of the season presented another opportunity in the side, he took it with both hands. A fine performance against bitter rivals Real Madrid saw the Slovenian make his case to be the number one at the Spanish giants. 

Since then, he hasn’t looked back, growing in stature, confidence and ability by the season.



Read  |  Victor Valdés: the under-appreciated mainstay in Barcelona’s greatest era

Oblak has worked hard to become fluent in Spanish, forging a rock solid partnership with his central defenders, Uruguayan pair Diego Godín and José Giménez. Over the lat few seasons he has cemented his status as one of the world’s best, for both his handling and shot-stopping as well as his composure, winning LaLiga’s Zamora Trophy for three seasons straight. Within two of Victor Valdés and Antoni Ramallets already, Oblak is on course to become, statistically speaking, one of the greatest domestic goalkeepers in history.

It’s an unsurprising feat, considering the Atleti man uses clean sheets for currency, reaching a milestone of 50 or the club in just 86 games. His 100th clean sheet came this season against Borussia Dortmund in a 2-0 group stage win in the Champions League, making him the hardest goalkeeper to beat in world football right now, alongside Alisson Becker at Liverpool. Indeed, a 55 percent clean sheet rate is quite the record.

Oblak, however, is not without his negatives. Amongst the new wave of ball-playing goalkeepers, the Slovenian is a throwback to those of yesteryear, a master with his hands, but less so when playing an intricate passing game out of the back. Perhaps that’s why the likes of Pep Guardiola, Maurizio Sarri and Jürgen Klopp stayed away from the Slovenian when choosing their new stoppers.

At 1.88m, he’s the perfect height for a goalkeeper, blending agility and speed with strength and reflexes. He’s an expert at taking crosses and often waits until the very last second before committing himself at the feet of opponents. For many who watch LaLiga regularly, he’s the world’s best goalkeeper.

At just 26, with his best years firmly ahead of him, rumours of a move Juventus, Internazionale and others around Europe have emerged, though a contract extension looks most likely for the man aiming to lift trophies at home and abroad with Atleti. Indeed, club captain Koke recently said, “If I was in charge here, I’d give him a blank cheque.” Quite the praise for one of the world’s most underrated footballers.

=== HOW THE AIR FORCE, A SLICE OF A LUCK AND A PLAYOFF MATCH SAVED ATLÉTICO MADRID AFTER THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR ===
12/10/2018 by DAN PARRY

Football stadiums always seem to fall foul to the perverse nature of war and its cruel ability to turn something designed to bring joy and entertainment into a monstrous monument of death and fear. It comes down to the fact that the structural solidity, adaptability and locations of stadiums can convert them into prized military possessions during urban conflicts.

By the end of the Spanish Civil War, Real Oviedo’s stadium, the Buenavista, as well as the rest of the picturesque city, lay in ruins. Soldiers had dug a giant trench stretching from one goal to the other, whilst severe and prolonged bombings destroyed the rest, ensuring that the ground would be incapable of hosting a football match for quite some time.

After overthrowing the Republican government and securing victory, the new leaders of Spain looked towards restoring law and order in beleaguered Spain. One of the early items on the agenda was to revive the country’s premier football league, LaLiga.

Real Oviedo, unable to take their place in the competition due to the extensive damage done to their stadium, and the significant loss of playing staff, requested that the league’s organisers grant them a year’s reprieve in order to sort everything out. The Spanish Football Federation allowed the Real Oviedo to defer their re-entry into the competition and two clubs subsequently staked a claim to the place forfeited by the much-maligned Asturians. 

On the one hand there was Athletic Club de Madrid, now named Athletic Aviación due to merging with the Nationalists Air Force’s side, Nacional Aviación. In the last campaign before LaLiga was suspended, Athletic Club de Madrid had finished in 11 in the 12-team tournament. As the two bottom teams were normally relegated, Athletic Aviación argued that they had the sporting right to play in the league. Logic would dictate that if a club drops out then the one that finished in 11th should replace them. 

On the other hand, Osasuna, who finished bottom of the league in 1936, had been promised a spot in the league during the war. It was to be a reward for the actions of the province of Navarra, and its capital Pamplona, in helping General Franco claim victory.



Read  |  The story of Pichichi, the Athletic Club great who lives on forever

This caused a difficult situation for the federation and the government. Athletic Aviación held much sway; they had powerful links to the government through the Air Force and a top-tier side based in the middle of Madrid with a nationalist connection. It was an enticing prospect to the powers that be. However, at the same time, it rarely looks good for a new and unelected regime to renege on its promises, especially one made to an ally that could be essential in maintaining control over the tempestuous northern provinces.

The solution was simple. The federation organised a playoff at a neutral venue, the Mestalla. The winner would compete in LaLiga, while the loser would be relegated to the Segunda. What couldn’t possibly have been known back then, though, was that this match would be a defining moment in the creation of a footballing dynasty.

By the time the war came to its conclusion in 1939, Athletic Club de Madrid found itself in a precarious position. Los Rojiblancos had lost socios (members), staff and players (most of them victims of the conflict); it had debts worth a million pesetas and the stadium, El Estadio Metropolitano, having been in the district which became the frontline during the battle for Madrid, had suffered a fate not too dissimilar to that of Real Oviedo’s Buenavista. The club was on the brink and the swirling waters threatened to engulf them. 

Club Aviación Nacional was formed in Salamanca’s Matacán air base in 1937, the brainchild of three high ranking nationalist Air Force officials. They recruited former professionals and talented players from within their own ranks and they played – and often won – a series of fundraising friendlies as the war moved across the north of Spain until they reached Zaragoza, where the club was assimilated into Aragón’s provincial championship in 1939. The side won the regional title, qualified for the Copa del Generalísimo, and got as far as the last eight, until they were knocked out by eventual winners Sevilla.

Club Aviación Nacional wanted to do more than maintain their existence after the fighting ended and their executives were eager to see their foundation at the top end of the national game. But they weren’t willing to start at the bottom of the pile and work their way through Spain’s complicated lower-league system, so the most rational alternative was to join forces with another club.



Read  |  The mysterious career of Charles O’Hagan, Sevilla’s first foreign manager

Very soon they relocated to Madrid, where they sought to find an outfit with which they could enact their plans. To those sides based in Madrid, the arrival of Aviacón Nacional presented a head-splitting conundrum. They would gain all of the Air Force’s considerable resources and political clout, but they would have to surrender a large part of their identity and autonomy. Not accepting the air force club’s conditions also presented a risk in that it might harm their standing in the Madrid’s footballing hierarchy. 

At first, Aviación looked to make a deal with Real Madrid – then called Madrid Football Club, they dropped the ‘Real’ part of their name when the Republic began – but Los Blancos couldn’t bring themselves to accept the demands of Aviación, which included the presence of air force officials in the boardroom as well as altering the club’s badge and name. 

This left two options, Nacional de Madrid and Athletic Club de Madrid, both of whom were in dire need of help. Ultimately, the directors of Athletic did a better job of convincing Aviación that striking a deal with them would be more beneficial. Negotiations weren’t straightforward, though, as Athletic Club de Madrid harboured many of the same doubts and fears as Madrid. 

Under the conditions of the agreement, the club changed its name to Athletic-Aviación Club (becoming Club Atlético Aviación in 1940 after Franco banned Anglicisms), incorporated the wings of the Air Force’s emblem into its existing badge and the boardroom took on a number of new directors, but the club’s red and white striped tops were left untouched. The new links to the military also offered some other interesting advantages. For example, the ailing squad would be replenished with talented players from Aviación, they would have first pick on any player who was serving in the air force, and, best of all, the ability to use military transportation, which was absolutely vital in post-war Spain.

Later, in 1939, rivals Nacional de Madrid went bust, suggesting that Aviación’s intervention might in fact have been a “club-saving blessing” as Euan McTear remarks in his book Hijacking La Liga.

With the merger complete, Atlético looked towards the future, with all that stood between them and a spot in LaLiga a pesky playoff. Coached by legendary Spanish goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora, fresh from exile in France, Club Atlético Aviación went to Valencia on 26 November 1939 hoping to settle the matter of their right to play in LaLiga.



Read  |  Patrick O’Connell: the forgotten hero who saved Barcelona and won LaLiga with Real Betis 

The Pamplona-based side seized control in the early stages and took the lead courtesy of Vergara in the 20th minute. Ten minutes before the break, Atlético Avación found an equaliser through Enrique. After half-time, Atlético gained the upper hand once again thanks to a goal from Vazquez in the 54th minute. With 15 minutes left on the clock, Enrique popped up once more to turn the tie irrevocably in Atlético’s favour, granting them a place in LaLiga and sending Osasuna down to the Segunda.

How different things might have been for Atlético had they not emerged as the winners of that match. Zamora and his charges would go on to win the competition that season before repeating the feat in the following campaign. Over the course of the next decade, the club would go from strength to strength, becoming the dominant force in Madrid, if not all of Spain. This period of control would inspire an almighty response from city rivals Real, leading them to their own trophy-laden golden era in the 1950s. 

In 1947, the club’s official alliance with the Air Force came to an end, the reasoning being that they had fulfilled their mission in rescuing and restoring the side. The wings were removed from the badge and the club changed its name to Club Atlético de Madrid. In the years since, Los Rojiblancos haven’t shied away from their historic relationship with the air force. After all, if it wasn’t for that agreement, the club probably wouldn’t exist.

The club’s ties to the air force and, therefore, the higher echelons of Franco’s regime has led to accusations of nepotism, though in reality, saving the club was all the mattered. Indeed, history has shown that Franco had little interest in football, or at least didn’t support any particular club, unless it served some political end for himself. He was a pure opportunist, who had no reservations about using and abusing whatever tool was available for preserving control or furthering his own twisted agenda. His decision not to automatically favour Athletic Avación over Osasuna, or vice versa, the lauding of Real Madrid throughout the 50s, and many other actions in relation to the sport serve as examples of this.

The threads of history are thin and delicate, and a move from one entity can cancel the existence of another. It’s easy to indulge in thoughts of the hypothetical when looking back through time. What would have happened to Atlético Madrid if Real Oviedo’s stadium hadn’t been ruined? If Club Aviacíon Nacional had joined up with a different club? Or if Osasuna had won the playoff? 

The reality, however, is this: war almost destroyed Atlético de Madrid, but a mixture of fortune and canny business brought them back from near annihilation. That’s more than can be said for a lot of teams from Spain’s post-war era.

=== The Lungs of Atlético de Madrid: “Profe” Ortega’s behind the scenes impact, Part I ===

****Author’s Note: After Atleti laid a Cristiano Ronaldo-sized egg in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal at the Bernabéu, now is not really an apt time for a feature on the origins of the squad’s collective grit, willpower, and fight; however, though Cholo deserves a lot of credit for his values and the style that he has brought to Atleti, it’s important to know that he delegates the execution of those values to another, under-appreciated man.

These days, the common narrative surrounding Atlético Madrid characterizes the team as a band of brothers, an underdog, a less-wealthy, less-talented group that manages to masquerade as a top dog in Europe through sheer force of will. Diego Simeone has his team foaming at the mouth, and they run out onto the pitch so jacked up that they cover more ground, win more 50/50 balls and play more defense than their opponents in service of a set of values, the Atlético Way. Atleti players - like Koke from Madrid’s obrero Vallecas neighborhood, or the combative Gabi - are avatars of the working class, and they just somehow, some way want it more.

And it’s partially true -- Atleti play a lung-busting brand of football. And when a football team plays as Atleti play - a style that infamously drove Arda Turan to Barcelona because he didn’t want to run so much - you need to be willing to run all over the pitch. And in order to run all over the pitch throughout 90 minutes - to make the grade at Atlético - you need to be in beyond tip-top shape.

As such, it’s not just an underdog mentality that leads to Atlético outworking its opponents. While Simeone gets a lot of credit for firing up and inspiring the team - the “partido a partido” creed, the standard “Player x works very hard, and that’s why he played so well today” postgame comment - there’s a lot of preparation and training that goes into Atleti’s signature style, a lot of deliberate and mindful planning that creates the squad’s ability to outrun and outlast other teams.

That’s where Óscar “El Profe” Ortega comes in.

Verbose, authoritative, and short, with small, piercing eyes and a shock of dark, receding hair, Profe Ortega doesn’t cut the most imposing figure. However, on pitch, his sharp wit and at times overwhelming intensity - he often talks to the squad about “assassinating” the other team while they warm up - command the respect of footballers worldwide. He is the engine, the man who carries out Cholismo behind the scenes.

Another important Uruguayan at Atlético, El Profe developed his life and footballing philosophy - which would align closely with Simeone’s - as he learned his lessons and took his lumps playing kick abouts on the streets of Montevideo.

“In my neighborhood, you had to be lively. There was only one ball to play with and if you weren’t fast, you didn’t play, and you couldn’t hop on the rear platform of the bus without having to pay. I gathered golf balls to make money. I had to help my family, including when I began to work in soccer in addition to teaching rugby at the British college in Montevideo.” — Óscar Ortega
At the age of 21, El Profe became a global man, a world traveler who worked stints in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Japan and Argentina. In 1999, Ortega arrived in Spain, earning a job alongside Marcos Alonso at Sevilla. In the early 2000s, Ortega would move on to a pair of short stints at Atlético de Madrid. While working for Atleti, Ortega met Diego Simeone, who was still playing his last days in the red and white. Thus began a beautiful friendship.

After leaving Atleti, Ortega shouldered much of the blame for Gregorio Manzano’s disaster at Malaga during the 2004-05 season, with several injuries leading to a relegation scare for the Andalusian side. Ortega didn’t last the whole season, as his entire technical team was fired in January. In need of image rehabilitation and a new gig, Ortega turned to his old friend. After Simeone scored his first managerial job in 2006 at Racing Club de Avellaneda in Buenos Aires, he offered Ortega a job on his technical staff. As Simeone climbed his career ladder, so did Ortega, who followed his friend to Argentina, Italy, Spain and beyond, moving to Estudiantes de La Plata, River Plate, San Lorenzo, Catania and - finally - back to Atlético.

Check back Monday for Part II.

Part II primarily deals with how Ortega organizes training, the philosophy behind his training exercises and how training reflects the Atlético mentality. For an account of Ortega’s background and history, read Part I here.

While Diego Simeone handles the motivational speeches and has created the ethos of the current iteration of Atlético Madrid, he delegates all physical preparation - and a good deal of practice planning duties - to Oscar Ortega. El Profe focuses on two things in particular — efficiency and balance. As Ortega himself said, “I have to search for efficiency in everything that I do. We depend on a method that focuses on efficiency, and we have to work a lot on balance. We look for efficiency because we are faced with a league that has 38 matchdays, and that forces us to look for balance.”

RELATED

El Profe’s focus on balance aligns perfectly with Cholo’s partido a partido, game by game philosophy. Weekly matchups determine Ortega’s preparation. If an opponent likes to have the ball, has good touch and likes to play between the lines, Ortega amps up the intensity and work rate in practice, utilizing exercises that may not even require a ball. If an opponent is solid at the back, El Profe and Cholo work more with the ball, focusing on combinations that can break down the first line of defenses.

Like Simeone, El Profe controls every detail of his sessions. He pulls tactics and drills from sources as far-reaching as boxing, American football, basketball, track, pilates, volleyball and TRX — in which players are suspended from harnesses that allow for body weight/gravity to provide resistance. El Profe emphasizes strength, speed, intensity, flexibility and coordination, and scoffs at the notion that all useful exercises must involve the use of a ball. El Profe also plans and controls each individual player’s schedule and activities and collects data on players, down to minute details: while making an appearance on the talk show El Hormiguero, Antoine Griezmann and Koke confirmed that El Profe subjects them to daily weigh-ins.

Surprisingly, one of the larger influences in Ortega’s methodology is rugby. Since he worked as a rugby coach during his younger days in Montevideo, El Profe extracted what he could from the sport - namely, the system of grids, which led to direct confrontations, such as tackles, in different sectors of the pitch - that apply to fútbol as well.

No matter how varied the methods, Ortega has Simeone’s complete trust, and they present a unified front to the world and to the squad. Ortega will gladly emphasize that his training program is designed specifically for Atlético, and that his training and Cholo’s inspiration and mentality have a symbiotic relationship. In his own words, “We create the exercises, but the ball doesn’t come to you itself. You have to go and get it.”

And ultimately, it is in large part this unified commitment to an overarching philosophy - from Enrique Cerezo on down to Simeone and Ortega - that has led to Atleti’s unprecedented success in recent years:

“Direction, coaches, the technical staff, and the players are all aligned,” Ortega told AS. “We’ve all worked to give an identity, a belonging that is very important. For those who arrive it’s easy, though they must adapt. But they know where they’re headed. Naturally it wasn’t like this at the beginning, but today we have everything so that the new arrivals become a part of a defined idea.”

“Direction, coaches, the technical staff, and the players are all aligned. We’ve all worked to give an identity, a belonging that is very important. ” — Profe Ortega, to AS
The Atlético Way is all well and good — it informs a lot of organizational decision making, and new players certainly know what to expect when they walk in the door. However, knowing what to expect and being able to live up to those expectations - being able to sacrifice for the greater good and being able to grind through sometimes unbearably intense, vomit-inducing training sessions - are two different things.

When a new, hyped signing arrives at Atlético, he is almost immediately met with his first test -- the crucible of Atleti’s summer training. In the late summer, the prime months of the unrelenting heat of the Spanish capital, on the 5th and 7th holes of the Los Ángeles de San Rafael, Segovia golf course, Profe Ortega puts the squad through three-a-days. As Fernando Torres said - half-joking - “This is hell, and (Ortega) is the man responsible.”

It may be hell, but it also serves as a sort of weed-out ordeal. Like a college organic chemistry class that alters the career plans of countless no-longer-future-doctors, El Profe’s initial training sessions are a litmus test for who can hack it at Atlético and who can’t. Though Griezmann initially struggled with the intensity of Ortega’s training sessions, he adapted and it’s safe to say that he’s worked out. On the other hand, Luciano Vietto reportedly never got used to the intensity of El Profe’s sessions, and we haven’t heard much from him lately.

In this sense, Profe Ortega is Atlético’s gatekeeper, the man who puts new charges through their paces and determines whether or not they’re fit to pull on the red and white shirt. El Profe has as much say as Simeone in this arena.

Those who make it are inducted into the family. “Training camp” ends with a big family-style group dinner at Restaurante José María, Atleti’s favorite restaurant in Segovia. After surviving the summer training sessions, players are rewarded with a feast, including entire pigs. They now are a cog in the machine.

And ultimately, this machine is directed by Simeone in terms of the club’s dogma and in-game strategy. Cholo is the public face of everything that Atlético currently and historically stand for. Cholo is the one who adjusts his tactics when things go sideways, the one who fires up the players in the dressing room and raises the roof in the Calderón when the crowd gets too quiet. But El Profe is the executor of Cholo’s vision, the one who puts it into practice through the daily grind, the one who makes sure that occurrences like Tuesday’s toothless struggle against Real Madrid are few and far between.



=== The Passion of the Jesus ===
Written by	Johnny Proctor
Feb 10, 2016 

Football has always had it’s share of larger than life, colourful characters, but at times across the world within the beautiful game and throughout a sport that has eternally had the ability to write as many stories away from the pitch as on it. It hasn’t always just been the players themselves who have courted controversy and made front page headlines as well as on the back. Team coaches and managers themselves have perennially made the news with their wild, eccentric and at times unexplainable conduct in the line of duty when in charge of their side. Through that though it does beg the question just how is a Real Madrid player expected to behave if their own coach is poking a finger in the eye of an opposing manager or, more recently what the Napoli players were to make of their gaffer Maurizio Sarri making homophobic comments towards Internazionale coach Roberto Mancini? Obviously, like in any other company or organization, leading by example is something that is both expected and demanded. What if however if this way of thinking was extended further up the chain PAST the Jose Mourinho’s of today and the Brian Clough's of yesteryear. Going straight to the top of the family tree of any football club is your Chairman or El Presidente. If they can’t be expected to forever be in possession of a moral compass, and if history has taught us one thing, they haven’t, then what chance for your up and coming young striker, or even Doris the tea lady for that matter?

In the UK we have had our fair share of the eccentric and downright badly behaved club owners and Chairmen over the years. You had Lebanese Wimbledon owner, Sam Hammam who was one of the trailblazers in crazy football club Chairmen. A man who had a clause inserted into his manager Bobby Gould’s contract that allowed Hammam to overrule Gould’s team selection anytime prior to 45 minutes til kick off on any match day. Hammam also, after leaving Wimbledon and taking over Cardiff City, had it written into new signing Spencer Priors contract that the centre half would “have to engage in physical relations with a sheep and then eat it’s testicles afterwards” (Where Prior’s agent was during this point of the negotiations is a very pertinent question!) The having sex with a sheep part was soon uncovered as “banter” from Hammam but he DID maintain that if Prior was to pull on the blue shirt of Cardiff for the first time then he would have to go through with the eating it’s cojones part. Apparently, a man of culture, Prior asked to have them cooked and seasoned with salt, parsley and lemon juice. After wincing his way through the ordeal the new signing was then told by a grinning Hammam that it had been chicken all along. In Scotland we had the legendary Jim McLean of Dundee United. Initially team manager and the man who oversaw the era where Dundee United announced themselves onto the European stage reaching European Cup semi finals and Uefa Cup finals respectively. An idol to all Dundee United fans he is remembered for so much during his time as both manager, Director and Chairman of the club. To the outside world with no affinity or links to Dundee’s largest club however, McLean is famous for one thing, well apart from being a football genius and possibly the worlds most belligerent man. Assaulting a BBC match reporter live on air during an interview will do that though. 

Asked a question he didn’t quite care for he abruptly ended the interview with a few expletives thrown in as he panelled BBC Scotland’s John Barnes off camera as he left. (No not that one) It was his last act on behalf of the club and the man who was only recorded as having ever smiled 5 times in his 29 years at the club, although 2 of those times may have been down to sun in his eyes, was gone by tea time. 

As always, whatever our British clubs can do, the Italians and the Spaniards can do better, with that little bit more style and assurance, and there’s no exception to that rule when it comes to nutter chairmen. In Italy, Perugia probably boasted a copocannoniere winner level club owner in Luciano Gaucci. An eccentric entrepreneur who initially held the position of Vice President at Roma before purchasing the team from Umbria. A club owner of such sane mind to think that it would be perfectly acceptable with the Italian federation for him to sign the best female players in world football. First looking at Swede Hannah Ljungberg before turning his attention to German World Cup winner Brigit Prinz. At the time Gaucci was quoted as saying “Seeing as she’s a citizen of an EU country, I repeat there is no such regulation that would limit her from playing with men.” Despite meeting with Gaucci, Prinz didn’t come to play for Perugia in Serie A in the end! Such nonsense was only the tip of the iceberg for the man who signed Colonel Gaddafi’s son, Saadi, just for the lolz, it certainly wasn’t for his footballing ability as he didn’t play one game for the side before being suspended for Nandrolone. He famously threatened to sack Ang Jung-Hwan after the South Korean international had scored the goal for his country that knocked Italy out of the 2002 World Cup. Following Italy’s exit, a volatile Gaucci was soon in the news, quoted “I have no intention paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football.” Despite a Gaucci u-turn who had by then offered to give Jung-Hwan a 3 year contract, the South Korean player never returned to Perugia post World Cup. 

All of Europe’s more unhinged attention seeking megalomaniac of Chairmen and Presidents pale into insignificance when put up against what is the heavyweight, in every sense of the word, and stick on Ballon d’Or winner for the most colourful, unpredictable and volatile club boss that world football has ever seen. Atletico Madrid President of 15 years, Jesus Gil. To anyone outside Spain he has only ever been recognised for his tempestuous presidency of Madrid’s second club. Inside Spain however he is known for more than just his lunatic like behaviour as President of El Rojiblancos. Construction tycoon right to politician all the way to his infamous stint as the disingenuous mayor of Marbella. Pre Atletico, Gil announced himself to the Spanish public in the most tragic of circumstances. As an entrepreneur he made his fortune in the 60’s building modern gated communities for the Spanish middle class and the foreign residents that had swarmed into Spain. In 1969, on one of Gil’s newly constructed complexes in San Rafael the roof in a restaurant collapsed killing 58 diners and seriously injuring scores more. It was discovered that the cement in the restaurant had not been given enough time to set, following an investigation it was then brought to light that the complex had been constructed without calling on such standard assistance on a project of this scale from either architects or surveyors, or building plans for that matter. It was a shape of things to come for the Spanish public when it came to Jesus Gil and his blatant disregard for what law dictated. 

He was sentenced to 5 years as part of the San Rafael tragedy however this was during the rule of General Franco in Spain and having pledged allegiance fervently towards Franco. Gil was handed a pardon by the General himself after only 18 months served. Launching himself back into the redevelopment and property game he ended up in the early 80’s in Marbella heavily buying into the sprucing up of the southern city in a meteoric rise that took him all the way to the mayorship of the city, three times re-elected by the city's residents. Elected in 1991, as mayor he would often be seen out for a stroll about the streets accompanied by a team of bodyguards, Gil verbally abusing the homeless and prostitutes which he felt threatened his vision for the playground for the rich and famous he was trying to create. It was during this era that he formed his own political party, Grupo Independiente Liberal, (Yes, GIL!) a political party that had prospered as a movement and by 1999 had contested 12 other municipalities, as well as Marbella itself. With this running alongside, by then, his position as President of Atletico. Gil very much saw himself as a Spanish version of Milan’s President and Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berluscomi. 

Construction deals as well as disasters and political aspirations aside. It was on the football side of things where the real fireworks, fourth of July style fireworks, lay. Despite actually being an Atletico Bilbao supporter, he was close friends with Vicente Calderon, who the stadium is named after today. Through this friendship, Gil saw himself invited onto the Atletico board in 1981. Six years later he was president of the club, and that’s when the real fun and games began. As Socio number 16,386, Gil turned up at Madrid nightclub, Jacara with a bemused Portuguese striker Paulo Futre fresh from his European Cup win with FC Porto, tucked metaphorically under his arm. His message to the Atleti members simply, vote for Gil and you'll see one of Europe's most wanted attackers in the red & white stripes next season. 

Gil won the presidency election by over 5 thousand votes and in doing so embarked on a journey that would see the brash and big bellied Spaniard go through an outrageous 44 coaches & signing 141 players over a period of 17 years. This certainly isn't the only example of entrepreneurial spirit taking a businessman to the presidency of a major football club. Florentino Perez across the city swept into power at the Bernabeu while engaging in the same tactic of promising to sign Luis Figo from hated rivals Barcelona should he take power. That is where the similarities between the President of Atleti and Real come to an abrupt end. Then again, in Jesus Gil, the foul mouthed, temperamental multi millionaire who grew up living in a brothel was quite simply beyond comparison with anyone. A man who has abused judges inside court, punched the president of rival club Compostela live on TV. The president who presented his own TV show, Las Noches de Tal y Tal where he would sit in a jaccuzi puffing on cuban cigars surrounded by an assortment of busty models although it should be stated, none as buxom as Gil himself. Someone who didn’t think twice about threatening to feed the Atletico players to his pet crocodile and the same person who ditched the club youth system, citing that there was no point and no money in it only to lose striker Raul to his most bitter of rivals across the city where he became one of the most potent goal scorers modern day football has ever witnessed. Despite never admitting it publicly this one particular move must’ve smarted somewhat because if there was one thing that Gil hated, even more than judges, it was Real Madrid. Over the years, Gil turned baiting Los Blancos into something of an art form. Everything that Gil did, he did it loudly without one single fuck given and never more apparent was this when he had Real Madrid in his sights. No question about it, he was always good value for money and never short in providing a good laugh to the world of football but the question is was he good for Atleti? 

Yes and no would be the answer to that question. Through his crooked dealings he, consistently , brought unnecessary and unwanted attention to the club. That together with his numerous fall outs with the Spanish Football Association eventually saw Atleti ostracised and on the occasions where they required help from the FA none would ever be forthcoming. Directly involved in 80 court cases, it was impossible for the club not to be compromised by their larger than life president and his “poor” business decisions. He loved Atletico with a passion though, even if he did on occasion have a funny way of showing it. He admitted to often consulting with his horse, Imperious, on potential player transfers. When he would be left less than satisfied over a final score he had a habit of errupting live on air in ways that would make Kevin Keegan seem like he was the worlds most chilled man during “that” interview years ago on Skysports. On the occasions that Atletico lost a match it was a real life equivalent of the cartoon Wacky Races when it came to the Spanish TV networks and radio stations to get to him first while he was still in the “red zone.” If you got hold of Gil at that point, you knew it was going to be good, if you were brave enough to actually confront him that was. 

After a 4-3 loss to Villarreal, and mere days after he had been in hospital to have a new pacemaker fitted, he exploded live on air “It was an absolute disgrace, there’s too many bloody passengers” As Gil let rip, his anger levels rising and rising, a concerned but fearful reporter bravely reminded him about the new pacemaker and suggested to Gil that he might want to relax a little. Incandescent with rage by this point, Gil had Spaniards trying to picture the anatomically impossible with his response to this piece of advice. “I’m sick of people telling me to relax, they can shove my heart up their arses” Unstoppable by this point he wasn’t finished, “Carreras, Santi and Otero are not good enough, I feel like not paying them and anyone who doesn’t like it can die.” The irony in this was that he hadn’t paid ANYONE at the club for 2 months. Something that was confirmed by Otero when asked by reporters for his thoughts on what Gil had said about him not being good enough and that he wasn’t going to pay him. “Does that include the two months that he already owes us?” 

Always quick to criticise the side he was equally as quick to celebrate the good times. When Atletico stunned the nation and specifically the big two of Barca & Real by winning the domestic double of La Liga and Copa Del Rey. Gil celebrated this by riding around Madrid on an elephant, as you do. These are some of the things he did do but the things that he didn’t quite carry out? Every bit as crazy. The Formula one team, the aircraft carrier that he wanted to sit at Marbella harbour. Probably for the best, one of his other wishes that didn’t come to fruition was when, during another of his infamous radio interviews after an away defeat at Las Palmas, he expressed the wish that the Atleti plane would crash on the way back to Madrid and kill the whole team! 

His unpredictable and abrasive behaviour was always just put down to the fact it was Jesus Gil, and that’s just how he was and he wasn't ever going to change. It was the incessant court cases which brought him down eventually where even Gil himself admitted that he was hurting the club. No stranger to the inside of a court room, he was forced to resign as Mayor of Marbella in 2002 following embezzlement accusations. With €390m euros of council funds discovered as not being fully accounted for he resigned and was put in prison for the third time in his life. Imprisoned to prevent him from tampering with evidence that would go on to be crucial to the case built up against him. Also during his stint as Mayor, over €30m euros had been “misappropriated” from the municipal pot in what the Spanish press dubbed “the football shirts case” where at the time Atletico were sponsored, conveniently, by the city of Marbella. Even as Gil died from a heart attack in May, 2004, aged 71, the “Caso Atletico” court case was reaching it’s final proceedings. The by then, ex Atletico President, accused of illegally helping himself to 236,056 Atleti shares as part of a floatation that as club president, a venture that he had overseen. 

He was loved and loathed not just over the whole of Spain but within the stands and corridors of the Vincente Calderon. Despite the mixed emotions towards a man that always played by his own rules and wasn’t against cheating when the need arose. The feeling of loss was all too evident as Atletico Madrid took to the field against Zaragoza. Fittingly, in tribute to Gil, the Riojablancos didn’t mark the game by winning but by losing. For a team who have embraced the tag of eternal victims, a football club who’s very own hymn contains the line “What a way to suffer, what a way to lose” To do anything other than lose on such an occasion simply wouldn’t have been Atletico Madrid. After days in hospital, Gil’s heart finally gave up on him. His coffin was wrapped in an Atletico flag as it was lowered to the ground. Then Mr Atletico and his curmudgeonly ways was gone. There's no denying that Spanish football has been a lot quieter and much less colorful as a consequence.


=== In Atlético Madrid’s Ramshackle Home, an Underdog’s Spirit Thrived ===
By RORY SMITH MAY 9, 2017

MADRID — On a warm spring day outside Estadio Vicente Calderón, home of Atlético Madrid, a couple of workmen in fluorescent yellow vests are attending to a large steel door. One has the easier job, languorously holding the door in place as his colleague strains to tighten a dozen studded bolts in turn. After a few minutes of grunting and heaving, the two men swing it open and shut, open and shut, to test that it is firmly fastened.

It feels fitting, somehow, that just a few weeks before that door closes for good — along with all of the others in this peeling, patchwork concrete bowl a gentle 15-minute walk south of downtown — there is still work to be done. The Calderón has always had the air of a place that would be wonderful, if only they could finish it.

Time, though, has run out. The Calderón has long looked as if it is on its last legs; now it actually is. The next three weeks or so will act as one long goodbye, as this stadium, one of the most intimidating in European soccer, ticks off the milestones on its road to ruin.

On Wednesday, the Calderón will host its final European game, the second leg of Atlético’s Champions League semifinal against Real Madrid. For a club that has long nursed an inferiority complex to its wealthier, more glamorous neighbor, the game is the perfect send-off: Real Madrid won the first leg, 3-0, ensuring that what should have been an evening of noise and passion and hope will almost certainly end in disappointment.

Atlético will play its final league game here on May 21, and a week later, after a showpiece exhibition game between a team of Atlético legends and another of some of the most famous players to grace the Calderón as visitors, the stadium will be closed to soccer for good. Eventually, two skyscrapers will rise in its place alongside a landscaped public park, part of a redevelopment plan. Sentiment cannot stand in the way of progress.

That, certainly, is the rationale behind Atlético’s decision to leave this place behind and look, unapologetically, to a brighter, bolder future. A new home, to the east of the Spanish capital, not far from the airport, awaits the club — starting this summer, Atlético will play in the 67,000-capacity Wanda Metropolitano.

“It will be the most advanced stadium in Europe,” said Pedro Sanchez Garrabe, the owner of El Doblete, a bar tucked into the side of the Calderón. “It will be fantastic.”

It will also be lucrative. The new stadium, designed by the architects Cruz y Ortiz, has already enabled Atlético to sell more season tickets than it ever did at the Calderón. The money-spinning corporate facilities are extensive. It is sponsored by Dalian Wanda, the Chinese property conglomerate that owns a chunk of the club. It meets all of the Union of European Football Associations’ five-star criteria, and is already slated to bid to host the 2019 Champions League final.

It is, in other words, a sleek, gleaming vision of the future, one in which Atlético is one of Europe’s superpowers, just a notch below Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. It is the sort of a home befitting a team that has reached two of the past three Champions League finals and — though it would take a virtual miracle on Wednesday — could theoretically appear in a third next month.

There is sadness at leaving, though, for all the promise of what tomorrow might bring.

“My life, my memories, are at the Calderón,” Atlético striker Fernando Torres said. “My greatest days as a fan and as a player are in this stadium. Coming here when the stadium is gone will be difficult.”

Atlético has not always played at the Calderón — it only moved in, vacating its old home, the original Metropolitano, in 1966 — but those ramshackle stands hold memories. Not all of them are happy: that is not the Atlético way.

“It is a club that knows what it is to suffer,” said Raddy Antic, the coach who led the club to arguably the finest season in its history, when it won the Spanish league and the Copa del Rey in 1996.

Antic can take some credit for the magic that makes the Calderón special. Serbian by birth, he spent four years at Luton Town in England at the end of his playing career before embarking on a long, illustrious managerial career. When he arrived at Atlético in 1995, he suggested “a few changes from what I had seen in England” to make the stadium more atmospheric, and to entice fans to spend more time there after games.

Pushed for his favorite memory, though, he singled out the day he became “the only manager to fly over the stadium.” With the field too dry to play, Antic suggested hiring a helicopter to water the grass. He decided to hitch a ride. “I saw the stadium from above, all of it,” he said. “That is really special to me.”

Atlético, though, is a club that has learned to cherish the lows, too, to wear them as badges of honor. Three years after Antic’s double, Atlético was relegated. The next year, “we had more season-ticket holders than we had in the first division,” said Carlos García Cantarero, its coach that season.

“Nowadays, when teams come out onto the pitch, they come out together,” he said. “But then, the visiting team used to go out first. We would always wait a few minutes before we joined them, to let them see what it would be like to play there, with all of those fans.”

The club, of course, knows that it will take time to replicate that atmosphere at its new home, that these things cannot simply be packaged up and transplanted.

“Football is not just the game — it is the ritual of the day,” Antic said. “It is how you go to the game, where you stop for a drink, what you do when you leave.”

Atlético is doing all it can to prepare for that.

“We move in September or October,” Sanchez Garrabe said, standing behind the bar he has run for 25 years, surrounded by its collection of Atlético scarves, pennants and pictures. “We have not been told exactly where we will be in the stadium yet. It will be a big job — like opening a new business.”

He is content, though, that the club is doing all it can to safeguard its identity, to ensure the past has a place in the future.

That is not impossible, even in a sport as susceptible to nostalgia as soccer. Juventus moved into a new stadium in 2011 and thrived, for example. Atlético clearly thinks a new home will improve its financial outlook, and help it shed that long-held sense that it is destined to live, impoverished, in Real Madrid’s shadow.

But it is also defined by its current home. Atlético and the Calderón fit perfectly: a little rough around the edges, a little scuffed and gnarled, always a work in progress. That is the spirit that Diego Simeone, Atlético’s coach, has instilled in his team, the spirit from which all of Atlético’s recent success has stemmed.

Atlético will soon have a stadium that rivals those of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern and Manchester United, a stadium suited to a modern superclub. The question is whether this is a club suited to a modern superstadium.

Atlético is not a commercial juggernaut, like Bayern, or a luxury brand, like United. Its identity is as the eternal underdog, forever punching above its weight. A stadium is just bricks and mortar and, in the case of the Calderón, a highway underpass tucked under one grandstand. But it can be an avatar, too. That is what the Calderón is to Atlético: a manifestation of what the club is. The club has to move. Sentiment cannot stand in the way of progress. But there is always a risk that something is lost along the way.

=== The cholismo champions ===
Atlético Madrid’s resurgence has been thanks to discipline


Game theory
May 27th 2016
by J.M.
“PAPA, why do we support Atléti?” The question, posed by a young boy to his father in a 2006 television commercial, was a reasonable one. Why, if you lived in the hometown of Real Madrid, the most successful team in the history of the European Cup and Spanish league football, would you follow their less glamorous neighbours Atlético Madrid? In the 30 years to 2006, Atlético had won La Liga twice to Real′s 13 times, had spent two years in the second division at the turn of the century, and had endured a decade without a major trophy while their local rivals assembled a squad of expensive “galácticos” and collected three more European Cups (now known as the Champions League). The commercial ends with the father staring hauntedly into the distance, unable to explain to his son why both should endure supporting a weak team in a city of champions.
A decade on, his son’s question is much easier to answer. In 2009, Los Rojiblancos ended their silverware drought by winning the Europa League, European football’s second-tier tournament. They repeated that achievement in 2011, won the Spanish knockout competition (the Copa del Rey) in 2013, and beat Barcelona and Real to the La Liga title the following season. On May 28th, they will play Real in the Champions League final, the second time the two sides have met at this stage in three years. Real triumphed in 2014. But even if Atlético lose again, their appearance in club football′s most important game is a sign of their change in fortunes, and a challenge to the long-standing duopoly of Spanish football held by Barcelona and Real.

To succeed, Atlético have had to overcome financial disadvantages. According to the most recent edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, Atlético′s annual revenue of €187m ($208m) was three times less than either Real’s (€577m) or Barcelona’s (€561m), and little more than Newcastle United’s (€169m), who have just been relegated from the English Premier League. The club has used these modest earnings to pay off enormous debts. Between 1987 and 2003, Atlético was run by president Jesús Gil, who excelled at racism, homophobia and sacking managers (his 16-year reign included 38 managerial changes)—and also at fiddling accounts. He died in 2004 while serving three and a half years in prison for financial mispractice when making Atlético a public company in 1992. Gil left behind one of the worst-run teams in Europe, with debts that reached €300m by 2009, and €514m by 2011; at that point, the only Spanish clubs to owe more were Real Madrid (€590m) and Barcelona (€578m). Yet their significantly higher revenues gave the two giants of Spanish football debt coverage ratios of around 80%. Atlético’s was a paltry 19%, worse than all but two of the 20 sides in La Liga.
Since then, La Liga de Fútbol Profesional has introduced financial regulations that compel clubs to pay off their debts. Atlético have responded shrewdly. Over the past five seasons they have run a surplus on their player transfer accounts, spending €34m less than they received—in contrast to the €204m and €183m deficits generated by Barcelona and Real respectively. When they did splash out for expensive signings, the gambles paid off. The club bought talented strikers Sergio Agüero and Radamel Falcao for a total of €63m. The pair scored 170 goals between them, and were then sold for a collective profit of €42m. The youth academy, which Gil had closed—causing Raúl, a future star, to move to Real aged 15—has also contributed to Atlético’s resurgence. The club has kept hold of Koke and Saúl Ñíguez, a pair of talented young midfielders, and cheaply re-signed the striker Fernando Torres and the club captain Gabi, both of whom had departed in leaner years.
Meanwhile, under the guidance of Peter Kenyon, a former chief executive at Manchester United and Chelsea, the board has sought foreign investment, as has become common in the Premier League. Shortly after Atlético appeared in the Champions League final in June 2014, club officials travelled to Beijing to meet with Wang Jianlin, the billionaire chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group, a Chinese property company. Mr Wang then bought a 20% stake in the team the following January. Fairer distribution of television revenues within the Spanish league has also helped. Barcelona and Real Madrid used to receive 12 times more money than the smallest teams in La Liga. Today, the ratio is now closer to 4.5:1, and next season it will fall to 3.5:1. This will push Atlético’s TV revenue up from €41m last season to about €95m next year, by which point they hope to have cleared their debts.
This more disciplined approach has been apparent on the pitch, too. Under Diego Simeone, a former Atlético player and now the manager, Los Rojiblancos have become an efficient, streetwise team. Mr Simeone’s nickname is “El Cholo”, a Spanish term which originally denoted Latin Americans of indigenous heritage, but now is associated with gangster culture. His tactical philosophy, which acknowledges that Atlético are the underdogs, is known as “cholismo”. Mr Simeone′s sides typically use an old-fashioned 4-4-2 formation, sitting deep as a compact defensive unit. Without the ball, Atlético are like the Leicester City side that won the English Premier League playing guerrilla football: both teams typically have less than half the possession, and led their leagues in tackles made and passes blocked this season. Atlético have mastered this art, and conceded just 18 goals in this La Liga campaign—a rate of 0.47 per game, the lowest level of any team in the “big five” European leagues for a decade. In attack, however, their approach is different than the Foxes′. Where Claudio Ranieri’s side employed rapid counterattacks to cut through opponents, Atlético's build-up is more ponderous. Los Rojiblancos’ ratio of passes to shots is 36:1, less like cut-throat Leicester (26:1) and more like intricate Arsenal (37:1). 
Will their dogged defence be able to contain the brilliance of Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale on Saturday evening? Odds on Betfair′s betting exchange suggest that Real have a slight edge, with a 54% chance of winning their eleventh European Cup. Whatever happens, young fans of Atlético are no longer asking why they support Madrid′s second side—but, as in a recent commercial, whether they get to play in a final every year.

=== Understanding Antoine Griezmann’s Role at Atletico Madrid ===

Understanding Antoine Griezmann’s Role at Atletico Madrid

When he signed for them this summer, Antoine Griezmann’s move to Atletico Madrid seemed odd to many soccer fans. Griezmann had been linked with several Champions League teams from England so why would he move from one second-tier elite Spanish team to another? That was the question on the lips of many, which only explains how little fans appreciate the genius of Diego Simeone or what he’s building at Atletico Madrid.
The Simeone Model for Competing as a Second-Tier Elite Team

I’ve written before about Simeone’s tactics so I won’t get into the specifics of his system here. Rather, I want to talk about the broader principles that shape how clubs like Atletico, Borussia Dortmund and Southampton are able to compete with far wealthier rivals. In many ways they are simply conducting themselves as savvy smaller businesses would when trying to compete with wealthier competition. If you try to tackle them head-on on their own turf, you’ll get destroyed by their superior resources.
But if you can find a way to shift the playing field so that the bigger team’s superior resources become less important, then you have a chance to win. So Atletico refuses to play the game that their bigger rivals want to play. To shift metaphors, Atletico are rather like a guerrilla force fighting a wealthier, better-armed opponent. If they meet them in the open field, they will be badly beaten. But if they can choose where the battle is fought and fight it on their terms, they have a good chance of victory. What this implies, of course, is two things:
First, smaller clubs wishing to compete need to know what “fighting on their terms” means. So they need a well-defined tactical approach.
Second, they need to be able to impose that structure onto the game in order to make sure the game goes the way they want it to go.
This doesn’t need to be a one-size-fits-all approach, of course. If you think of smaller teams with defined tactical styles you can find everything from the low-block counter-attacking Atletico teams of Simeone to the frantic pressing sides of Jurgen Klopp and Roger Schmidt to the patient, possession-based approach of a team like Swansea who, though not on the level of Atletico and Dortmund, have still won a major trophy in recent years and are now taking steps to become a bigger power in the English game. The key though is that you have to be able to force teams to respond to you tactically.

View image | gettyimages.com
Put another way, for these squads adaptability is actually a bad quality to have because it implies that you’re letting your opponent dictate the way that the game will be played. And when you do that against Real Madrid, Barcelona, or Chelsea you’re bound to struggle. Do note though that forcing teams to respond to you does not necessarily require aggressive attacking. That’s how Klopp and Schmidt choose to approach it and it is also what Mauricio Pochettino and Brendan Rodgers try to do with Tottenham and Liverpool. But Swansea can force teams to respond to them by patiently keeping possession and forcing the opponent to chase them. And Atletico force teams to react to them by sitting deep, moving as a unit, and being a constant threat to break quickly on the counter. Atletico controls the game by allowing their opponent to have the ball in their attacking third for far more time than most teams would deem safe.
Before we leave this point, one more vital point needs to be made: Obviously if you want to have such a dominant tactical approach, you need the right players to make it work. A player like Diego Costa is perfect for Atletico and would also do reasonably well for Jurgen Klopp or Roger Schmidt. However, he would be far less effective in a more possession-based approach as is favored at a club like Swansea or even Manchester City. This is what made replacing Costa so difficult for Atletico and is why they ultimately settled on the solution of using two players to replace his role in the team. There simply aren’t many center forwards in the world who combine strength, pace, and defensive work-rate in the way that Costa did.
Atletico’s Counter Style
Most of the time Atletico has a similar countering approach to that used by Wolfsburg that I described here. They want to win the ball in wide areas and break from there with purposeful long passing to a specific player rather than long balls lumped forward in a more conventional route one style.
That said, many German teams tend to use a system based on what’s called gegenpressing in which you attempt to win the ball back immediately after giving it away. Atletico is not nearly as aggressive in their pressing. They can close on the ball very quickly when they want to, but most of the time they allow the opponent to have the ball and simply wait to spring the counter attack. Once they won the ball, they could attack in one of two main ways. First, when they had Costa up top, they could win the ball, play it forward to Costa and let him do the rest. The goal below scored against Celta Vigo–managed by current Barcelona boss Luis Enrique at the time–is a good example of this: diego-costa-goal-vs-celta-vigo In other cases, Atletico would rely on a different approach, winning the ball down the wing and letting the wide midfielders and fullbacks advance the ball down the flanks until they get into position to play that killer ball into the box. That can happen early in the run as a through ball played into the channel or later in the run as a cross into the box. The Atleti excel at both. The goal below shows one example of this more patient counter goal. Atletico won the ball in midfield, advanced it slightly and then played a simple through ball into the channel that Costa picked up and finished: diego-costa-goal-vs-sevilla There aren’t many strikers in the world who could score both of those goals. The first requires enough pace to outrun the defender, enough strength to bounce off him when he challenges, and then finishing ability to beat the keeper. It’s mostly about physical ability. The second goal is different.
Though both goals rely on an aggressive ball played forward, this second goal is mostly about football intelligence and technique. Costa had to know how to time his run and then be able to find the space between defenders where he could receive the ball. He also had to have a perfect first touch in order to control the ball. And note that while the first goal is scored off a long ball he controls with his chest this second goal is played into his feet. And Costa only takes one touch before shooting–an absolutely remarkable first touch where he drags his right foot behind him slightly and pushes the ball forward and slightly outside to take it away from the defender closest to him. Then he buries the chance with a great shot hit across the goalkeeper’s body toward the far post.

Unfortunately for Atletico, Costa left for Chelsea last summer. So the Atleti did something clever in their attempt to replace him. Rather than grabbing a striker with similar skills who may or may not be up to carrying Costa’s workload, they grabbed two of the best players available and set them into a system where they together could do what Costa did. First, they added Mario Mandzukic, a former Champions League winner with Bayern Munich who could do some of the hard work that Costa did and who had good finishing ability in front of goal. That said, he lacked the pace that made Costa such a dynamic player for the Rojiblancos. Enter Antoine Griezmann.
Antoine Griezmann’s Role at Atletico Madrid
Griezmann is a wide attacker who made his name at Real Sociedad alongside Carlos Vela, a former Arsenal attacker and Mexico international. He was known for being a quick, clever runner on the flanks who had the ability to cut to the line and cross the ball into the box or to get round the defender, cut inside and look for a shot. Here are his best moments at Real Sociedad:

Griezmann wasn’t renowned for his finishing ability or for his strength, but he was fast, fairly direct, and great running in space with the ball. Atletico snapped him up, beating out Arsenal to sign him. However, it took Griezmann several months to settle in with Atletico and during that time their attack struggled as they became extremely dependent on their set piece threat.

At the winter break, Atletico had scored 34 goals, 19 of which came from set pieces, accounting for 55% of their goals. No other La Liga side scored more than eight set piece goals during that time. It was a remarkable record, but it arose out of necessity caused by their lack of counter attacking threat as Costa was gone, Mandzukic wasn’t particularly adept at the kind of rampaging runs that Costa specialized in, and Griezmann had not found his form since his move.
But in the nearly six weeks since La Liga resumed, Atletico have found their counter attacking style again and Griezmann has been at the heart of it. There were actually hints of a revival prior to the break as Griezmann picked up a brace against Athletic Bilbao. Here is his second goal. Watch where the ball comes from, where the player receives it, and how the chance is finished. It’s a vintage Costa goal scored by Atletico’s new attacker.1)

And since the new year Atletico have scored 13 goals, nine of which have come from open play with only one set piece goal during that time. Thanks to Griezmann’s ability to take up that part of Costa’s role in the Atletico attack the Rojiblancos are once again looking like a dangerous counter attacking side able to hit opponents quickly and score on the break.

=== Guerrilla Football – How Atlético Madrid Conquered World Football ===

30 May 2016 by Jon Mackenzie 0 Comments

Diego Simeone – the creator of ‘cholismo’
Although Leicester City have stolen the headlines this season with their improbable acquisition of the Premier League trophy, there can be few clubs in world football whose rise to prominence is more extraordinary than Atlético Madrid’s. A team who were playing in the Spanish Segunda División as recently as 2002, last weekend they found themselves in a second Champions League final, battling against their rivals from across the city, Real Madrid. Yet whilst Atlético might be able to claim parity with their opponents on the field (this season, they have drawn and beaten Real in La Liga and only finished two points behind them in the table), off the field they remain clear underdogs: in the most recent edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, it was revealed that Atlético’s revenue (€187 million) was three times smaller than both Real’s (€577 million) and Barcelona’s (€561 million). In fact, with Atlético placing at fifteenth on this table—two spots above Newcastle United (€169 million) who were relegated from the Premier League this season—the full extent of their recent elevation cannot be overstated. What has been happening at the Vicente Calderón in recent years is nothing short of remarkable.

Atlético Madrid could lay claim to the inauspicious achievement of being Spain’s third biggest team: judged in terms of European competitions they only trail Real and Barcelona, although Athletic Bilbao pip them to third place when it comes to domestic titles. However, before their La Liga triumph in 2013/14 the majority of their ten league titles and ten Copa del Rey wins had been achieved more than a decade earlier—a solitary Copa del Rey in 2012/13 ended a domestic trophy drought of 16 years. The slump in Atlético’s recent history is generally attributed to the insalubrious presidency of Jesús Gil, a property developer who gained notoriety in 1968 when one of his buildings collapsed killing 58 people. After it was discovered that he had neglected to employ surveyors or architects during its construction, Mr Gil would serve 18 months in prison before receiving a pardon from General Franco. In 1987, he went on to become president of Atlético where he excelled at racism, homophobia and sacking managers (through the period of his 16 year presidency, he dismissed 38 managers).

By the time of Mr Gil’s death in 2004, Atlético had become one of the worst-run clubs in Europe, a fact attested to by the size of their debts. In June 2011, these debts had reached the staggering sum of €514 million, putting them at third in the liability table of La Liga clubs—€132 million higher than fourth-placed Valencia. This implausibly large sum of money owed put Atlético in the same ballpark as Real Madrid (€590 million) and Barcelona (€578 million). However, with their significantly higher revenue, the two giants of Spanish football could boast a debt coverage ratio of around 80% as compared to the paltry 19% of Atlético. At the time, only two other La Liga sides could boast a worse ratio. Since then, La Liga de Fútbol Profesional has introduced financial regulations that compel clubs to pay off their debts. Such fiscal interventions could have ruined Atlético Madrid. Instead, the club is thriving.

Much of this success off the field has to do with success achieved on the field and this has everything to do with one man: their manager, Diego Simeone. The peculiarities of Simeone’s particular brand of football have tended to be described using the curious label cholismo. The word cholismo, which remains untranslatable, derives from Simeone’s nickname, El Cholo. In the US, the word ‘cholo’ has been adopted within slang culture to denote people of Latin American descent, usually Mexican, who are low-income, ‘tough’ and who wear clothes generally associated with gangster culture. Distilled to its essence, cholismo is basically a form of guerilla football. Accepting the gap that had opened out in Spanish football between the two top teams and the rest of the league, Simeone decided to use this to his advantage. The earliest iterations of his Atlético side would utilise a basic 4-4-2 formation, sitting deep as a compact defensive unit and only breaking this shape when the chances of success outweigh the odds of failure. Yet where this basic approach was not exactly unique within world football, Simeone augmented it with an aggressive pressing strategy. His team were required to be fanatical in their pressing, fighting for every ball in such a way that antagonism became an asset. In effect, Simeone had taken the inequality inherent within La Liga and crafted an ethos out of it which allowed the club to emerge as a precocious contender in Spanish football and would lead them to La Liga triumph in 2014.

Yet what is often overlooked about cholismo is its financial advantage. Where the style of football played by Real and Barcelona necessitates the purchase of marquee signings whose value becomes inflated as a result of the interest shown in them by these teams, cholismo requires energetic, disciplined players who will buy into the underdog ethos of the side. And such players tend to come with a much-reduced price tag. The financial benefits to this approach are immediately obvious when tracing Atlético’s transfer figures from the last few years. In 2012-13, Atlético gross spent a very modest €4.5 million on their way to the Copa del Rey title. The following season this increased to a still respectable €36 million, which only makes their La Liga triumph that season more impressive (that season Barcelona gross spent €101.2 million and Real Madrid gross spent €175.5 million). In recent times, the club have attained parity with their rivals across the city: this season, they gross spent an incredible €136 million, but this expenditure has been entirely funded by outgoing transfers (€147.8 million this season). As their players increase in value, their transfer budget expands. In many respects then, the recent financial health of Atlético can be directly linked to the success of cholismo.

Yet as the transfer budget of Atlético Madrid has developed, so has the tactical side of their game. Looking back to their recent campaign in La Liga, Atlético conceded just 18 goals at a rate of 0.47 per game, the lowest level of any team in the ‘big 5’ European leagues for a decade. At the same time, they attempted more tackles than anyone in La Liga and required the fewest saves. In this sense, the basic defensive aspects of cholismo remain as fundamental as ever for Simeone’s side. Interestingly, however, Atlético seem much less proficient on the counter attack, scoring only three goals on the break all season. Much of their attacking play is now worked through the left-hand side of the field, through Koke in midfield and Griezmann upfront. In fact, Griezmann, with his 22 goals in La Liga this season, can hardly be described as a guerrilla footballer at all. As their pedigree continues to improve, therefore, Atlético are developing cholismo to reflect this progression, allowing space for the more talented players that their budget can now afford.

Atlético’s on the pitch success has been accompanied by shrewd financial management off the pitch. Mr Gil Marín, under the guidance of former Manchester United CEO, Peter Kenyon, has adopted a model comparable to the one employed by Mr Kenyon in the 1990s: encourage foreign investors, build a new stadium, seek to boost revenues wherever possible. Even so, in spite of this financial judiciousness, the club have also been the beneficiaries of a huge slice of luck: in the last few years, under government pressure, the TV revenues within the Spanish leagues are being redistributed more fairly. Where Barcelona and Real Madrid used to receive a sum twelve times higher than the other teams in La Liga, the ratio is now closer to 1 to 4.5 and next season will be reduced further to 1 to 3.5. This will push Atletico’s TV revenue up from €41m last season to about €95m next year.

Despite the result of last weekend’s Champions League final, Atletico Madrid have every reason to feel positive about the future. Within the space of twenty years, they have risen from the Segunda División into the highest echelons of world football, securing two Champions League final appearances out of the last three. Yet this improbable turn of fortune has not been achieved through irresponsible overspending, but through the application of a sensible ethos by the club which maximises their potential as outsiders within La Liga. With their implementation of cholismo, the underdog football, Atletico Madrid give hope to teams around the world in an age where money, so often, seems to be everything.


=== Diego Simeone always wanted to do something special: Carlos Aguilera ===
Thursday , May 8 , 2014
A STAFF REPORTER

Carlos Aguilera Martin
Calcutta: Former Spanish World Cupper Carlos Aguilera Martin is someone who has seen Diego Simeone from close quarters. Both were with Atletico Madrid during their playing career and the present Director of Grassroots & Head of Atletico Academy feels even then Simeone had a sharp mind.

“He was a different guy. Always thinking about how the opposition will react to certain situations and giving his inputs. He was a leader on the field and always wanted to do something special. I am not surprised that he is doing wonders with the present Atletico team,” Carlos said after the launch of the Atletico de Kolkata, on Wednesday.

Simeone was part of the Atletico team which won the double — La Liga title and Cope del Rey — in 1995-96, but ironically Carlos was with Tenerife. The former defender however is not sad about it. “Well I had a great season with Tenerife and my favourite Atletico also won the double. I was on cloud nine even though I wasn’t part of that squad,” he said.

The World Cup is round the corner so the conversation naturally veered towards Spain. “Well, Spain have a very balanced side. We are the world and European champions. But this World Cup will be in Brazil where they are different proposition altogether. So it will not be easy for Spain. That’s my personal feeling.”

Barcelona are not having a good run this season and most of the players in Spanish national squad are from the Catalan giants.

Carlos doesn’t think that poor form in the club shirt will have an effect when they don the national jersey. “Look they are all world-class players. This season, Barca did not live up to the expectations because they were bogged down by injuries. But I do not think they will not perform well in Brazil. It’s the World Cup after all.”

National coach Vicente del Bosque will depend a lot on Atletico’s in-form striker Diego Costa. The Brazilian-born decided to play for Spain last year and Carlos thinks it’s a big boost.

“He is one of the best in the world. Spain can only benefit from his presence. We in Spain are very happy that he chose us and not Brazil,” he said.

Carlos, who visited the Big Three clubs and also had a look at the Pailan facilities on Wednesday morning, said overall it was a satisfying experience. “It’s okay. But you have to work hard,” he said.

Diego Simeone was a cult hero for his performances on the pitch when the Rojiblancos last won the league (and the cup) in 1996, bringing 250,000 out onto Madrid’s streets to celebrate. Simeone returned to Atleti as coach in December 2011 when they were 10th in the table, four points above the relegation zone and dumped out of the cup by lowly Albacete. They’d just sacked Gregorio Manzano, who had been there only six months, the 49th managerial change under the club’s current ownership regime.
One of many was Ron Atkinson, appointed in late 1988. He propelled Atletico from near the bottom of the league to third, but was sacked after 96 days by a president he called ‘Mad Max’, aka Gil, who oversaw a vividly chaotic reign. “Jesus was a big man, around 6ft 5in, built like a fighting bull with a larger-than-life personality – almost beyond the normal rules of sanity,” said Atkinson. “Controversy was his favourite, almost obsessive game and he did love hogging those headlines. He strutted around and left me with the impression of what Benito Mussolini must have been like in his early days of power.
“One morning the local edition of Marca dropped on my desk. There on the front page was my boss, dressed in a convict’s uniform, his huge jowly face peering through the bars of a prison cell.” That mocked-up tabloid stunt was prophetic: Gil would later be sentenced to jail for a litany of financial crimes, the chief being embezzlement from his own club.
Atkinson won 11 and drew two of his 15 games in charge but was dismissed, he suspected, because he refused to play the injured defender Andoni ‘the Beast of Bilbao’ Goicoechea. Atleti’s former doctor of 25 years had been sacked and taken legal action against the club. In one of his statements, he said that Goicoechea wouldn’t play again. Gil wanted to prove him wrong. Although Atkinson had still not been told he was fired, Gil offered the job to assistant Colin Addison, who accepted. Atletico paid up Atkinson’s three-year contract in full. “Jesus Gil was an impressive character,” said Atkinson. “He was just too powerful for the stability of the club.”

Big Ron was eventually sacked by Big Gil
Atkinson next saw Gil three years later when he was commentating on an Atletico versus Manchester United match – which television viewers in Britain didn’t get to see, as Gil pulled the plug on the cameras 80 minutes before kick-off. So Atkinson had no game to commentate on, but that didn’t stop Gil describing him as his favourite enemy, bursting into laughter and crushing him in a giant bear hug. “By that time Miguel Gil, the son of Jesus, took executive control of the club and the whole place seemed to reflect far more stability,” said Atkinson.
Gil Junior is still chief executive. Twenty-two years and 34 coaches after Atkinson, the hero of the first Spanish team to win the league and cup double took charge.
Warrior
“Milinko Pantic was the playmaker, but Simeone was the main man at the club – apart from Jesus Gil,” recalls Quinton Fortune, who played at the Vicente Calderon before joining Manchester United. “He did everything to win.”
Of his own style, Simeone said he played as if he was “holding a knife between his teeth”. He still does everything to win.
Simeone’s predecessor, Manzano, had lasted six months but his attempts to rebuild a side after the sales of Sergio Aguero, Diego Forlan and David de Gea in 2011 had faltered. That said, a bright spot had been the form of €40 million new signing Radamel Falcao, the Colombian striker from Porto.
image: https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/styles/inline-image/public/simeone-falcao.jpg?itok=ZyoEY53F

Simeone and Falcao: won some stuff
Asked to compare Manzano with Simeone, the Brazilian Miranda, the best central defender in Spain this season, says: “There’s no comparison. It’s like I moved to a new team. Simeone is a great coach and is always trying to get the best out of every player. I’d say our side is 70 per cent better now. In all we’ve achieved these last two years, we owe a big part to him.”
Simeone doesn't do it all alone, though; assistant manager German ‘Mono (Monkey)’ Burgos is also credited with having significant influence inside the dressing room. The rock music-loving 44-year-old – and 35-time Argentina and former Atletico goalkeeper – is a formidable character. When Jose Mourinho was complaining in a December 2012 Madrid derby, Burgos rose from the rival dugout, pointed and said “I’m not Tito [Vilanova] – I’ll tear your head off.” There was little chance that Mourinho would have tried pinching the giant monkey, though he did offer verbal retribution when asked about the incident. “Mono Burgos? Who is this?” he asked.
image: https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/styles/inline-image/public/simeone-burgos.jpg?itok=szYBlCO2

Burgos, right, is Simeone's trusty Mourinho guard
Burgos, a former bin man and AC/DC fan, once said: “I couldn’t play at Real Madrid because of how I look. They’d make me cut my hair. Atletico is synonymous with workers. Atletico fans are brickies and taxi drivers.”
“He [Burgos] compliments the Mister really well,” says midfielder Gabi. “They’re both very strong characters, but they share their knowledge and strategies. We trust him. It’s important to trust an assistant.”
Father and sons
Simeone has had to sacrifice a great deal to return to Atletico. In 2011, when the club came looking for him to take over, he phoned his nine-year-old son Giuliano at the family home in Buenos Aires. “Dude, I have to tell you that Atletico Madrid called me. They want me as coach.”
“Really? You’ll get to go against Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo?” replied Giuliano.
“Yes, sure, but I have to move to Spain.”
“But we’ll be able to see the matches?” A long silence follows. Simeone knows his family will have to stay in Buenos Aires. It’s too risky to keep moving them around the world with different jobs.
Besides, all three of his sons are footballers with River Plate – one of five clubs he coached before Atletico – with the eldest, 18-year-old Giovanni, having broken into the first team. He knows nothing will be more painful than losing day-to-day contact with his boys and his wife, a model. Giuliano realises he’s not moving to Spain. “But if you win, you’ll not come back,” he says.
“That killed me,” says Simeone, “I didn’t know what to say to him.”
Simeone had started in management in his home city of Buenos Aires at Racing, the club he supports and where he finished playing in 2006. He moved to Estudiantes (who he led to a first league title, the Apertura, in 23 years), River Plate (he won the 2008 Clausura) and San Lorenzo. In January 2011, he joined Catania and fulfilled his brief of keeping the Sicilians in Serie A. He went back to Racing, his sixth job in four years, and led them to second in the league before Atleti came in for him. After family discussions, he was soon on the plane to Spain, charged “with positive energy”.
image: https://images.cdn.fourfourtwo.com/sites/fourfourtwo.com/files/styles/inline-image/public/simeone-cl.jpg?itok=ZbQreHW-

Leaving his sons "killed" El Cholo
“I was called in an emergency, but the team was good. They just needed a little change,” he explains. “There were similarities between Atletico and Racing. Both have an unconditional following of fans and they want to win the title but historically lose out. Atletico fans feel that they should win like Barcelona. Fans, eh? They told me that I had to make the Champions League.”
Simeone met his players and got straight to the point. “He told us that he’d always pick the best team,” says Brazilian full-back Filipe Luis. “What I appreciate about him is that he doesn’t have any commitment to anyone, agent or director. He picks the team he wants to. If he thinks our most decisive player, Arda Turan, is not doing well, he’ll take Arda out. He feels free to change the team whenever he wants.” That’s not a given in Spain, where presidential influence can have a bearing on team selection. 
But then Simeone has never been one for compromise, defining the terms for his team and players in relentless competition. “There is only one form of motivation, the lifeline of any team: internal competition. If there is no competition between players, the team dies. It’s the only situation which strengthens the coach.”
The Argentine is experienced enough to draw from his early work in management. “I don’t forget Estudiantes,” he says. “We managed to capture the football with which I most identified: practical, committed, simple, talented and from a collective effort.”
Respect
A club synonymous with talented individuals is now united with an unbreakable bond. “People would leak stories to the media which could be very damaging to the dressing room,” explains former player Diego Forlan. “I felt that the dressing room was tight, but I didn’t trust everyone close to it. We’d read negative stories – some true, some not – about us which undermined the team spirit. That was very frustrating as a player.”
 
Atleti’s shifting plates of power have long been their Achilles heel, yet even the seemingly eternal battles between Enrique Cerezo, the club president, and the chief executive, Miguel-Angel Gil, have calmed under Simeone. 
 
Away from his family, Simeone works intensely on his project. “He does such an excellent job before the games,” explains Miranda, one of three Brazilian regulars in the team. “He is always asking the players to give 100 per cent on the pitch, he practically neutralises opponents’ strengths and he takes advantage of defensive weaknesses so we go onto the pitch knowing what to do. He’s one of the best coaches I’ve worked with.”
As many a coach has found to his cost, coming to a new club and installing a meritocratic selection system is fraught with potential problems. But then it helps if you’re a club legend.
“Manzano had a difficult situation from his first day as he had never been accepted by the fans,” says Filipe Luis. “He cared too much about not letting anyone be mad at him, rotating the team every single game. Simeone – no. He arrived when the team faced a relegation risk, but he had been an idol of the club as a player and that helped.”
An Atletico idol he certainly is; beat Real Madrid in Saturday's Champions League final and he'll become a god at the Vicente Calderon. Whatever the result, he's not far off that status already.

=== WHEN BIG RON MET BIG JESÚS ===
23 DECEMBER, 2014 DALIA MCGRATH	
Ron Atkinson was an average footballer but a pretty good manager. It didn’t take him long to get to the top. It was quite straight forward, actually. Three years at Kettering Town as player manager, four over at Cambridge United leaving on the verge of promotion to the Second Division -what now would be the Championship- and another three at West Brom. There he showed himself to the world.

He was the first ever manager to field three black players and he got the team to fight with the top dogs. After finishing fourth in the 1980-1981 season, he got the call every single manager dreams of: Manchester United. Dave Sexton had been sacked and Old Trafford was looking for a new Lord of the manor. He won quite a few titles during his tenure in Manchester but in the 1986-1987 season, after the departure of some of the top players, the results didn’t go their way. He was sacked on the 6th of November 1986, swiftly replaced by some guy called Alex Ferguson. He returned to West Brom and then, in 1989, he got an interesting call.

Big Ron, as he was known, was looking for a new challenge. And that’s when he met Jesús Gil, the president of Atlético Madrid. He offered him the job of managing his team. He took his right-hand man Colin Addison with him. Big Jesús and Big Ron had big personalities. Gil was very outspoken and had a few clashes with the law in his 16 year tenure as the head of Atlético Madrid. Both made quite unfortunate racist comments: Gil about the Ajax team Atlético Madrid faced once, filled with surinamese footballers, calling them FC Congo, and Atkinson on TV in his later years, when he referred to Marcel Desailly as a “fucking lazy thick nigger”.

These two big personalities were bound to clash. After 96 days in charge, Ron Atkinson was sacked. He wasn’t doing too badly in the sporting side of things. He’d got them to second position, but big Jesús just didn’t like him. In various interviews, Atkinson called Gil “Mad Max” and said that “he left me with the impression of what Benito Mussolini must have been like in his early days of power”. Gil was quite authoritarian. Big Ron thinks he got the sack because he wouldn’t play Andoni Goicoechea, who was deemed unfit to play again by the ex team doctor, who was in a legal battle with the club at the time. Jesús Gil thought otherwise, and wanted to prove him wrong and made Big Ron play him. Atkinson didn’t comply and was sacked. The managerial job was subsequently given to his friend, Colin Addison. Big Ron wasn’t very pleased and went on the British media saying that Addison had stabbed him in the back. Ron and Jesús didn’t see eye to eye when it came to transfers either. Atkinson remembers in a column in The Guardian from 2003 that Gil told him they could have an Argentinian goalkeeper which they didn’t need, to which Gil answered: “Well, we’ll sign him anyway and sell him on to someone else”. Atkinson recommended another two: Jürgen Klinsmann and Thomas Hässler. So Gil bought an option on Klinsmann, but sold it on to Inter to make a profit.

Jesús Gil had to defend himself. In an interview given to El Mundo, he said that Atkinson didn’t care about a thing and was only worried about getting paid and about the club buying him a car and paying for his hotel bills. Going back to racism, he said that he saw Donato, the Deportivo de La Coruña legend, cry because Big Ron had called him a “negro de mierda” something like “fucking nigger”, but the translator at the time had softened the sentence.

Well, everyone would think that was it but no. Big Ron and Big Jesús met again. Atkinson was a successful TV pundit. One of his jobs was commentating on a game between two of his ex clubs: Atlético Madrid and Manchester United. Jesús Gil thought otherwise. He pulled the plug on the cameras at the game 80 minutes before kick off and the match wasn’t broadcast in the UK.

Miguel-Angel Gil Marín does so love it when a plan comes together. Which might just explain the permanently bewildered look on the face of Atlético Madrid's chief executive, majority shareholder and son of former Godfather Jesús Gil y Gil. Gil Marín, after all, is the man for whom plans don't so much come together as fall apart. This is the genius who celebrated the club's centenary by commissioning rough-voiced folk singer Joaquín Sabina to write a special hymn – only to be forced to ditch it because of an argument over copyright and to watch his side capitulate to an oddly appropriate defeat against Osasuna.

That day, Atlético chose a Stones track instead: You Can't Always Get What You Want. And, although he keeps avoiding what he really deserves, Gil Marín can't. He celebrated Kids' Day, complete with face-paints, free tickets and bouncy castles, by securing a 4-2 home defeat against a side that had not won away all season, thus securing a whole new generation of supporters – for Real Madrid. And he set up last weekend's game against Athletic Bilbao as a celebration of 100 years of wearing red and white striped shirts, a chance to reconcile fans and clubs, his coach calling it a game for happiness, "an amnesty" – only for his players to prove unworthy of the shirt, capitulating again as supporters departed early chanting: "We're sick of the Gil family."

 Listen
But this weekend, a plan did at last come together, with a little help from FC Barcelona, who now have the best record in Spanish football history. On Saturday night, Pep Guardiola's side defeated Atlético Madrid 3-0 with a hat-trick from Leo Messi, taking them to 16 successive league wins, a new La Liga record which allowed them to overtake Alfredo Di Stéfano's Real Madrid team of 1960-61 and maintain a seven-point lead at the top. It also meant Atlético Madrid have now gone four games without a goal. Gil Marín knew Atlético Madrid would lose at Camp Nou. In a weird sort of way, he also wanted them too. Which is why what might have happened last week might instead happen this week.

As for what really needs to happen at Atlético – the departure of Gil Marín and Cerezo – don't hold your breath.

Last Sunday, as fans trudged away from the Calderón in the pouring rain, they sang "¡Gil, cabrón fuera del Calderón!" ("Gil, you arsehole, get out the Calderón!"). And nothing makes a president or an owner's finger twitch like the fact that fans' fingers might, at last, be pointing his way. And so it was that Gil Marín decided that it was probably time to get rid of the coach Quique Sánchez Flores. Only it wasn't a very good time. What was the point, he reasoned, of getting a new coach in and burning him with a defeat at Camp Nou? Better to let Quique take that hit too and leave him to play for his job the following weekend – this Saturday – against his former club Valencia. Better to postpone it a week; better to give him one last chance. Safe in the knowledge that if he doesn't take it, you have the perfect excuse; and if he does, you can pretend you never planned anything of the sort.

Now, you might be thinking that's ridiculous. After all, Quique Sanchez Flores was the man who Atlético chose to bring in just over a year ago. The man who finally brought the club some unity at last, brought through youth-teamers David De Gea and Alvaro Domínguez, and performed what he described as a "mental cleansing" at the club. He was the man who took inspiration from the basketball coach Phil Jackson's book Sacred Hoops: Spiritual Lessons of a Hardwood Warrior – a book that talks of a "Zen Christian attitude of self-awareness", dismissing anger as a weed and hate as the tree. The man, above all, who won the Europa League and the European Super Cup: the first coach to win anything in 14 years and the first to clinch a European trophy in nearly half a century. The man who took his side to a Copa del Rey final.

But then Quique Sanchez Flores was, despite protestations to the contrary, Atlético's ninth choice as coach and his record was not what it appears to be. Atlético lost 23 times last season, Quique won only a third of his games and his team reached the final of the Copa del Rey having faced just one first division side – Racing Santander. They played in the Europa League by virtue of being desperately bad in the Champions League but not quite bad enough to actually finish bottom of their group and got through three rounds on away goals. They won just two in eight – and one of those was against Fulham. Their European record last year stood at: won two, drawn eight, lost four. That's relegation form.

And yet they won the Europa League. Then their defeat of Inter in the European Super Cup raised expectations. Unrealistically. Atlético were top for two weeks. But they should have known they had no chance of staying there when Marca's editor Eduardo Inda described them as the Third Way – a Third Way only marginally less meaningless and baseless than Tony Blair's. Atlético are 31 points off the top. "If we don't get into the Champions League it would be a failure," claimed Cerezo. This morning Atlético are eighth – 14 points off a Champions League place. They are out of Europe, defeated by giants Aris Salonica, and out of the Copa del Rey.

They are also only nine points off the relegation zone. "Maybe it's time to look up, not down," as one Atlético reporter put it last night. Quique Sanchez Flores's first 50 games in charge are the worst in the club's history. Of those who have even made it to 50 games that is. Since then, he has lost twice more. He has lost more times than he has won as Atlético coach.

Atlético's defenders continue to play on roller skates; Luis Perea's legs seem to have been attached by someone who read the instructions incorrectly; Felipe Luis and Diego Godín, the summer signings and good players, have caught the bug. Domínguez has disappeared. Even De Gea looks wobbly – and at 19 he's entitled to. There is no one to run the game, no one to create, and Diego Forlán looks utterly bored and uninterested, all too willing to talk of a future elsewhere, a victim of his own honesty and an alarming drop in form – last weekend he was whistled when he was taken off; this weekend he did not even start. Raúl García is a useful scapegoat – not least because he really isn't very good. Quique has not once used the same starting XI in two successive league games since he took over. The style changes, the personnel changes. Every week.

As for that Zen-Christian stuff, the squad is divided. Quique, says one player, "has little or no support". The fans, quite rightly, have had enough. There is no institutional support and the knives are out in the press. There is no faith or confidence. "I am scared of us going into a downward spiral," said Enrique Cerezo this morning, "I'm scared of us giving up." No wonder Quique talked about enduring moments when he felt "genuinely fragile" and "feared for my health". And that's the thing: it is not Quique's fault. At least not only his fault. Just as it was not the fault of the 17 other coaches Miguel-Angel Gil Marín has employed since 1996, none of whom won a thing.

The club falls apart around him. Cerezo and Gil Marín, the two majority shareholders, president and chief executive respectively, barely talk. They deliberately take contradictory decisions just to wind each other up. When Gil Marín recently noted that he had turned down a huge offer for Sergio Agüero, all he did was create tension around the club. When Cerezo returned from Miami, where he was celebrating Enrique Cerezo Day, all he could do is roll his eyes and mutter: "This wouldn't have happened if I was here," like nothing stupid ever happens on his watch.

Simão Sabrosa left, Jurado left and two players who no one is convinced by – Elías and Juanfran – replaced them. Forlán would have gone too but Spurs could not agree personal terms with him. When Atlético made a big noise about Agüero's new deal, few missed the fact that his buyout clause has gone down not up, with Real Madrid sniffing round. And rather than declaring eternal love and claiming that "I will be here as long as Atlético want me here", Aguero said: "I'll leave when I want to." Sadly, few doubt that he will want to soon enough.

Atlético Madrid are more than €100m in debt and soon they won't even have the thing that makes them special: identity. They are moving to a new stadium on the opposite side of town. Another season is in danger of drifting away at best or becoming a battle for survival at worse. And saddest of all, the greatest success the club enjoyed in more than a decade seems to have been completely forgotten already. But don't worry because Gil María has a cunning plan: sack the coach. Again. At the end of December, Miguel-Angel Gil Marín was named "football director of the year" by the Dubai-based Globe Soccer group. They might as well have handed Pol Pot the Nobel Peace Prize.

Talking points:
Results: Athletic 3-0 Sporting, Getafe 4-1 Deportivo, Osasuna 1-1 Mallorca, Barcelona 3-0 Atlético, Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad, Zaragoza 1-1 Racing, Almería 3-2 Espanyol, Villarreal 0-1 Levante, Sevilla 0-0 Malaga, Valencia 2-0 Hércules.

• Hang on, does that say Levante beat Villarreal? Bloody hell, it does you know.

• Sometimes Barcelona and Leo Messi are a victim of their own boring brilliance. Let's face it, we really should be talking about them this week but what else is there to say? They have now broken the league record with a 16th successive victory and eased their way past Atlético in the opening 15 minutes on Saturday night. Messi scored a hat-trick, taking him to 24 for the season and – get this – 83 in his last 82 games for Barcelona. But more than the goal, the thing everyone is really getting excited about is the moment he dashed back 50 yards, took the ball off Agüero, dinked a pass round an Atlético player and set Barcelona back on the attack. "He is," said Quique Sánchez Flores, making the comparison that means even more to most Spaniards than Pelé or Maradona, "a 21st century Di Stéfano".

• Na Na Na Na Na, My Dad Is Bigger Than Your Dad Department: that Quique comment was one that Marca were not prepared to let go. All upset at someone not bowing down to kiss the feet of their lord and saviour (well, one of their three lords and saviours), they splashed their cover with "21st century Di Stéfano" this morning. Not Messi, but Cristiano Ronaldo – who last night got two more to take his total to 24 and a barely believable 50 in 51 games since joining Madrid. Mourinho's side battered Real Sociedad last night with Mesut Ozil particularly sparkling. Kaká played well too. And there was an impressive performance and a goal for Emmanuel Adebayor. That noise you can hear is probably a nail (not yet the final one, though) being hammered into Karim Benzema's coffin.

• "A toast to mediocrity." That was how AS's report of Sevilla-Málaga put it. And they could not have put it better. To think, Sevilla used to be worth watching. Once.

• With every passing game, Athletic Bilbao look stronger and Iker Muniain looks better – he produced a wonderful rub for the second this weekend, scored by Gaizka Toquero. They have now won four on the trot. They're six points off but a Champions League place looks a genuine possibility.

• Tino Costa doesn't do normal goals. He scored a beauty last night as Valencia beat Hercules 2-0. So poor were Hércules that they decided they might as well send on persona non grata Royston Drenthe. As he was waiting he was given a pep talk by the assistant coach, which presumably consisted simply of a promise: "It'll be in your account on Monday. Honest." Only let's face it, it won't.
=== Investigating the origins of Diego Simeone’s Cholismo ===
Illustration by Sisto Micheli. View more of his great work here
The path was clear for Antoine Griezmann. Bayern Munich’s defence had opened up before him and, courtesy of a nicely weighted through ball from Fernando Torres, he was clean through on goal. The imposing figure of Manuel Neuer bore down on the diminutive Frenchman but, with unerring cool, he outmanoeuvred his opponent. Opening his body up as if to shoot into the far left corner, he instead placed the ball firmly in the bottom right. Neuer was helpless.

The goal, outrageous in its simplicity, seemed too good to be true. After all, it had – through a couple of obvious touches – essentially concluded a Champions League semi-final tie. The Allianz Arena was stunned into silence. Griezmann and Atlético Madrid had scored a game-changing away goal. It was something they would cling to with ferocious desire.

They eventually lost 2-1 on the night but, thanks to their 1-0 win in the first leg at home, Atlético progressed to 2016’s Champions League final. And, as debate began to rage over exactly how successful Pep Guardiola’s Bayern tenure had been, equal attention was devoted to the man in the opposite dugout, Diego Simeone.

The man nicknamed ‘Cholo’ had led Atlético beyond both Bayern and Barcelona. He had guided his team through the toughest possible sequence of continental assignments to reach the promised land of European football. His infectious charisma had captured the hearts of neutrals and newspapers dedicated entire sections to his tactical philosophy, terming it Cholismo.

Atlético’s frenzied conductor, this commandeer of the touchline, had become perhaps the most surprising of footballing darlings. Cholomania had officially set in.

 

From Cholito to Cholo

 

The term cholo was originally used insultingly towards Latin American men of a lower class, though over time it has acquired new meaning. Nowadays, it is often applied endearingly to imply street smarts and toughness. Arguably the most famous cholo of all time was Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran, who accepted the nickname with pride having quite literally fought his way out of the slums. A pugilist who mixed canniness and an awareness of the dark arts with sublime skill, Duran perfectly exemplified the cholo as sportsman.

Diego Simeone was born into more advantageous conditions in the Palermo district of Buneos Aires on 28 April 1970. His mother was a hairdresser and his father a salesman, and he didn’t want for anything. He did, however, very quickly learn the importance of hard work, something that would prove beneficial given his eventual choice of profession.

He grew up at a time of great prestige as far as Argentine football was concerned. The country won World Cups in 1978 and 1986, and Simeone was inspired. He was determined to make his living as a footballer, even proclaiming as much when asked about his career ambitions by a secondary school teacher. His classmates burst out laughing, but the giggles didn’t change Simeone’s mind.

cholo diego simeone velez

A young Simeone at Vélez

• • • •

Having honed his skills on the streets he joined Vélez Sarsfield’s academy in the mid-1980s. There a youth coach, Oscar Nessi, labelled him ‘Cholito’ on account of his combative, feisty attitude to playing the game. The nickname made sense and would stick, though Simeone’s formative years with Vélez proved influential in other, more important ways.

As a boy, Victorio Spinetto had loved to fight. And, as a football player and coach, he was seemingly obsessed with the notion of manliness. A centre-half from Buenos Aires, he rallied against the concept of La Nuestra, a style of play based on trickery that prevailed in Argentina between the 1930s and ‘50s.

To proponents of La Nuestra, football was a show. But, for Spinetto, football was something to be won, nothing more and nothing less. Hence, when he took charge of Vélez in 1942, victory was the only thing on his mind. Over the next 14 years he would lead the club to the Primera División and achieve a runners-up finish with them, something Vélez had previously never done. During this time, Spinetto would also leave his mark on Osvaldo Zubeldia, a striker who played for him between 1949 and 1955.

Zubeldia bought into Spinetto’s vision of the game and refined it as he embarked on his own coaching career, achieving notoriety often for the wrong reasons. His Estudiantes side of the late 1960s were widely viewed as one of the ugliest teams around at the time. They employed gamesmanship, fouled incessantly and tactically, and defended doggedly. All in all, they weren’t easy on the eye. Then again, they didn’t want to be.

Carlos Bilardo was one of that Estudiantes side’s primary instigators. Playing in midfield, he underpinned the team’s anti-fútbol and would later take elements of Zubeldia’s tactics and leadership with him into coaching. Bilardo eventually led Argentina to their World Cup win in 1986 with a deeply practical, system-driven approach that completely juxtaposed the vision of his contemporary, César Luis Menotti, who had guided Argentina to their only other World Cup win in 1978.

While Menotti was engaged in finding the spectacular and the beautiful, Bilardo sought only results. There existed a clear rivalry of ideals, and the unique success of the pair only conflated the importance of the contrasts between them. Simeone grew up watching this narrative unfold, but from the moment he joined Vélez as a boy he was destined to be swayed more by Bilardismo than by Menottismo.

Spinetto, the inspiration behind Zubeldia’s anti-futbol, left management in 1978 but would spend the rest of his life helping to shape Velez’s youth scheme. He worked with the club’s academy at the same time as Simeone came through and was impressed by the budding midfielder, even stopping one training session to ask how old the young Cholito was. Simeone told him he was 15; Spinetto replied by stating that in two years he had to be in the first team.

Simeone would fulfil that expectation, making his Vélez debut on 13 September 1987 in a 2-1 defeat to Gimnasia. Three years later he would embark on a journey in European football imbued with career-guiding principles from his time with Vélez, particularly as part of their youth system. “There they taught me values, wash your clothes, respect, order everything that helps you in life,” he would later remark. “From order you start living better.”

There were echoes of Spinetto in those words, namely in the belief that discipline and organisation, as opposed to talent and skill, fuel the footballer. And these ideals would only be further embedded as Simeone’s playing career continued. After a two-year stint with Pisa he joined Sevilla in 1992, where he would see first-hand the effectiveness of Bilardismo. Bilardo had taken charge that summer and would lead the club to a respectable seventh place in La Liga.

These were the years when Cholito became the Cholo, as Simeone developed into a rugged midfield warrior with a cunning edge. When later asked what his greatest qualities as a player were, he would reply: “Perseverance. I always demanded a lot of myself, I set targets and went for them without letting myself get distracted. I (also) had one of the most important things a footballer can have, which is knowing your strengths as well as your weaknesses. I always tried to conceal my weak points.”

Simeone’s ability to manipulate was never clearer than at the 1998 World Cup, where Argentina met England in the second round. He careered through the back of David Beckham as the English midfielder attempted to control a bouncing ball early on in the second half and, when Beckham retaliated with a glancing kick up, Simeone fell to the ground theatrically. His provocation had worked and Beckham was sent off.

Cynical and tough, winning trumped aesthetics by a handy margin in the Cholo’s list of personal tenets. He carried this through into his own coaching career, in which – just as Bilardo and Zubeldia had done before him – he would take charge of Estudiantes in 2006. In his debut term in the club’s dugout, they would win the Apertura title, their first league triumph in 23 years. Unsurprisingly, the achievement was built on functionality, as they conceded a mere 12 goals in 19 games.

 

The Italian influence

 

In the 1960s, European football belonged to Milan. The city’s two major club sides, Inter and AC, dominated at home and on the continent; the former won three domestic championships and two European Cups in the decade, the latter won two domestic championships and two European Cups. This unprecedented spell came while Italian football was in thrall to Catenaccio, a system that was not overtly popular abroad due to the coldly clinical defensive style that often came with it.

At the time, Milan were guided by a coach in Nereo Rocco who adhered steadfastly to this system. He was also an uncompromising character, as described by Jim Hart, who wrote that: “Rocco was the undisputed leader in all other matters. Often seen raging on the sidelines, (he) would berate the referees, humiliate the younger players, and make life miserable for anyone who got in the way of his side winning the match.”

In 1963, Rocco left Milan for Torino, where he would work with Gigi Meroni, one of the great fantasisti of the era. Known as ‘The Butterfly’ for his delicate elegance, Meroni was capable of creating wonderful moments, such as his stunning chipped goal at the San Siro in 1967 as Torino defeated reigning champions Inter. However, another Gigi proved just as crucial to Rocco’s resurgent Granata outfit.

Gigi Simoni was nowhere near as glamorous as the low-socked Meroni, but he provided balance in Torino’s midfield as they climbed the Serie A table. “Meroni had more genius, (but) Simoni had more consistency,” Lido Vieri, Torino’s goalkeeper at the time, said. “They had different characteristics, but they were both talents.”

It’s reasonable to suggest that it was during this period of his playing days that Simoni learned the real value of stability within the team. That was, after all, exactly what he added to a Torino side that finished third in Serie A in 1965. His role was less noticeable than that of Meroni, the whimsical artist, but it was just as important to the team. Rocco, one of Catenaccio’s greatest exponents, had taught him well.

Simoni embarked upon his own coaching journey in 1974 and, after positive spells with a multitude of smaller clubs, he was appointed head coach of Inter in 1997. The Nerazzurri’s president, Massimo Moratti, was desperate to end the club’s long wait for a scudetto and, as well as hiring Simoni, brought in a number of new players including Ronaldo, who was signed for a then-world record transfer fee of £19.5 million. But perhaps the signing who suited the new coach’s ideals more than any other was Simeone, who returned to Italy after five years in Spanish football for a fee of £4.5 million.

Simoni’s inculcation in Catenaccio was clear in the way he set up this newly assembled Inter cast. He stuffed the midfield with battlers and ball-winners, with Simeone often partnered by two of Benoît Cauet, Aron Winter, Javier Zanetti or Zé Elias. The defensive line involved intensive man-orientations, meaning they had to follow their opposite men almost everywhere they went, while the team as a whole was instructed to defend deeply.

Ronaldo was the only player who wasn’t asked to get behind the ball in the defensive phase, instead acting as a sole outlet for counter-attacks, where his skill was hugely productive in one-on-one situations. The Brazilian was aided by an attack-minded left-back, usually Zanetti or Luigi Sartor, a pacey right winger in Francesco Moriero, and the technically gifted Youri Djorkaeff.

The football Inter played in the 1997-98 season was extremely reactive. La Gazzetta dello Sport accurately depicted it as “hit and flee, defence and counter-attack”. And, while it wasn’t quite as rigid as the original Catenaccio of the 1960s, the impact Rocco had had on Simoni, showing him the necessity of structure, was evident.

simeone interSimeone was an imposing, crucial figure for Inter

• • • •

The results were positive. Inter had the best defensive record in Serie A that campaign, conceding just 27 times in 34 fixtures and finishing second to Juventus. They also won the UEFA Cup, defeating Lazio 3-0 in the final thanks to goals from Zanetti, Ronaldo and Iván Zamorano.

Playing in the engine room of midfield, even occasionally dropping back into the defensive line when Giuseppe Bergomi was injured, Simeone’s tactical nous was integral to the club’s accomplishments that season, something his coach later acknowledged. “Simeone … was a coach already on the pitch,” Simoni told La Gazzetta dello Sport. “In my small way I knew that he would become a great one.”

Simeone would eventually return to Italy as a coach after spells in his homeland with – as well as Estudiantes – Racing Club, River Plate and San Lorenzo, taking the reins at Catania in 2011. With the Elefanti struggling to avoid relegation, Simeone immediately embedded some of the basic tactical fundamentals emphasised by Simoni during their time together at Inter. Immediately, the Sicilian side became hard to break down, with focus on retention of a deep defensive shape and incisive counter-attacking once in possession of the ball.

Catania avoided relegation under Simeone’s auspices, finishing the season in a comfortable 12th place. He left the club that summer, but the style of play he had opted for in Italian football was basically the same as that with which he would go forward elsewhere.

Six months after leaving Catania, he would be appointed coach of Atlético Madrid. But, while his environment was different, his principles essentially remained unchanged. Down the line, he would extol the virtues he found coaching in Serie A. “Catania was a real learning curve,” he said in September 2014. “I grew amidst difficulties. In terms of courage and ideas, a lot about my Atleti comes from Italy.”

 

Atlético Madrid and counter-hegemony

 

Simeone first signed for Atlético Madrid as a player in 1994. In doing so, he entered the world of ‘the other’. Los Colchoneros had, and still have, a long and proud history of being underdogs. Locally they stand a clear second to Real Madrid, whose indifference of the city rivalry only fuels frustrations on the Atlético side. Domestically, Atlético have also tended to lag behind Barcelona, who along with Real Madrid have won 56 of 85 Spanish league titles.

If Real are the Galácticos and Barcelona are a cultural symbol of regional pride, Atlético’s identity has always appeared much quainter by comparison. This is something the club has fed on from time to time, however, using it to generate a fervent atmosphere at their Vicente Calderón home ground, a place few teams have historically enjoyed visiting. During their periods of greatest achievement, Atlético have thrived on their otherness.

Simeone’s first year in Madrid was a confusing one. No fewer than four coaches graced the Atlético dugout in 1994-95, but Raddy Antić’s arrival in July 1995 brought about greater stability. The Serb introduced precise, purposeful football and the club won a league and cup double in his first term at the helm. Simeone, still only 24 years of age, matured tactically under Antić, played an instrumental part. Seemingly indefatigable, his relentless runs from deep were core to Atlético’s attacking ambitions.

Antić’s preferred basic shape was a 4-4-2 in which the midfield became very narrow without possession, compressing space available for the opposition to exploit centrally. They pressed intelligently as a collective and, when the ball was won, instantly looked to get it forward through a high-tempo, short-passing game. Atlético’s second goal in a 3-1 home win over Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona that season perfectly distilled Antić’s tactics and Simeone’s role within them.

An aimless pass into Atlético’s half was collected by left-back Toni, who immediately played the ball inside to Simeone. Controlling and turning, Simeone then bypassed the pressure of two Barcelona players through a one-two with Juan Vizcaíno, before playing another one-two, this time with striker Kiko, who had dropped deep. This quick sequence of vertical passes created space for Simeone to drive into before playing the ball wider to José Luis Caminero on the right hand-side. With Barcelona having unsuccessfully attempted to set an offside trap, Caminero played a first time ball across the penalty area for Lyuboslav Penev to sweep into the net.

• • • •

• • • •

Eleven touches from six players was all it took to penetrate the opponent and score a crucial goal. And Simeone, with his dynamism and spirit, relished his more attacking role within the system; that season he finished second only to Penev in the Atlético scoring charts with 12 to his name.

Antić was unable to repeat the success of his first season. Atlético fell to fifth in 1996-97 and, after the club finished seventh the following year, he was dismissed and replaced by Arrigo Sacchi. By that point Simeone had already left for Inter, but Atlético’s history, tradition and underdog status had truly resonated with him as someone who fought and thought for everything he achieved as a player.

That success against the odds wouldn’t leave him and, when he returned to the club as head coach in 2011, he did so fully aware of the need for a counter-hegemonic mentality and style. Real Madrid and Barcelona were as dominant, if not more so than they had ever been, while Atlético had been in a state of constant flux. In the two years prior to Simeone’s appointment, the club had hired three different coaches. His predecessor Gregorio Manzano had been sacked on the back of a cup defeat to third-tier Albacete, while in the league Atlético were just four points off the relegation zone.

The circumstances were not dissimilar to those which preceded the club’s league and cup double in ’96, however. And, having learned his trade and experimented tactically in Argentina and Italy, Simeone set about implementing and refining what would come to be known as Cholismo.

“We want a team with commitment,” he stated upon taking the job. “One that plays, runs, trains, respects the rival, and understands the intelligence in the game.” The tactical pragmatism and unabated desire for work which had been instilled in Simeone from his youth would be laced through his Atlético side.

 

The revolt against tiki-taka

 

If the players are what draw crowds to a football match, the ball itself is what compels the players to make the game their livelihood. That first touch, the execution of the pass, the shimmying dribble and the finish that ripples the net all act as testaments to the beauty of the ball. It’s an easy object to fall in love with, and an even harder one to let go. Asking a player to give the ball up is asking them to forget their most intimate relationship. Yet this is exactly what Simeone proposed to his Atlético side. There was no other choice.

Short passes had dominated the Spanish footballing landscape for years. The national team had won the 2008 European Championship and 2010 World Cup playing tiki-taka; Barcelona had won three consecutive league titles and two Champions Leagues with a similar style. Both teams were lauded and copied, held up as evidence of what football was supposedly really about, namely the ball. There were other aspects of course, such as a high defensive line, intensive pressing and counter-pressing, and positional rotation, but it was the ball – or rather how Spain and Barcelona used it – that enticed the masses.

Between the Catalan club’s mastery of possession and Real Madrid’s financial largesse, Simeone’s most viable option was to simply forgo aesthetics and wider popularity in favour of the brutal and efficient. He determined that, while they may not win awards for their style, his Atlético would embrace the struggle and succeed in it. Victory would supersede everything else.

Within five months Simeone had drastically improved Atlético’s results. They finished fifth in La Liga and won the Europa League. Following that, in his first full season in charge, they finished third in the league and won the Copa del Rey, defeating Real Madrid in the final. Then, in 2013-14, the remarkable happened, as Atletico won the league for the first time since ’96 and reached the Champions League final, where they lost to their loathed city rivals. Spain’s ‘big two’ had officially transformed into a ‘big three’.

The achievements alone were stunning, but the method underpinning them made them all the more intriguing. That season, Atlético had the ninth-highest average possession in La Liga, just 0.3 per cent more than Betis, who finished bottom. At a time when tiki-taka was widely held up as the absolute pinnacle of footballing possibility, Simeone’s side were unapologetically nonconformist.

Simeone

Read  |  What is ‘good’ football? The role of aesthetics in the modern game

• • • •

Their style of play was defence-first and focused on compactness. While other teams lusted after the ball, Atlético took pride in their monitoring of space and maintenance of shape. Their defensive record of 26 goals conceded was the stingiest in the league. And it didn’t stop there.

The notion of Atlético’s success as a one-time thing, an anomaly, was dispelled quickly. After a transition year in 2014-15, Simeone’s side returned to challenge domestically and continentally last season. Their method was the same but different: their counter-attacks were more concise, their passing more complex, their pressing more intense. This time they conceded just 18 goals in La Liga, finishing a close third, but it was in the Champions League, where they knocked out two giants of the modern game in Bayern Munich and Barcelona, that they won hearts as well as minds.

Simeone had captured the aura of otherness that ran through Atlético and mixed in his own personal beliefs and tactical influences to create a harmonious collective with a dangerous siege mentality. Their football was captivating in a way many onlookers simply hadn’t considered before. Suddenly the concept of not having the ball could stand rightfully next to the idea of having it.

 

Collecting the strands

 

No wonder Italians claimed Atlético’s victories in 2015-16 as their own. For years they had been criticised for playing in a similar fashion, without emphasis on ball possession. Giovanni Trapattoni, who was hugely influential in shaping Italian football post-Catenaccio, came out swinging, telling AS: “I’m not going to name any names, but there are teams that hold onto the ball for half an hour without ever shooting so I always fall asleep. Simeone and I are alike … we share a philosophy. His tactics are straight to the point and display more intensity. To say that is playing badly is a big lie.”

There are undoubtedly elements of Gigi Simoni’s Inter in today’s Atlético, but to imply their philosophy is some sort of modern Catenaccio equivalent is at best an innocent oversimplification – for starters, the marking is nowhere near as rigidly man-orientated. Cholismo is far more complex and involves many other themes; it cannot be boiled down to any one of Simeone’s experiences or influences, rather it appears to represent all of them in some small way.

Spielverlagerung’s Constantin Eckner describes Cholismo as: “Simeone’s philosophy in its entirety, (it) does not only stand for a certain kind of tactical system, but also for his training regime, his communication with players and his principles as a manager.”

Cholismo resembles Bilardismo in its borderline-Machiavellian win-at-all-costs attitude. Tactically, it reflects Simoni’s Inter in its reactivity, and Antić’s Atlético in its concision and purpose. It could even be suggested that there exists a hint of Bielsismo, the philosophy associated with Marcelo Bielsa, in Cholismo’s occasional freneticism; Simeone did play for Bielsa’s Argentine national team, after all. And it’s hard to argue against the role played by circumstance, considering Atlético’s place in the Spanish footballing hierarchy and the predominance of tiki-taka at the time of Simeone’s arrival as Atlético coach.

Ultimately Cholismo has multiple disparate roots, each one reflecting a portion of Simeone’s time in football, time he has spent working hard, learning assiduously and preparing with intent. “Effort is non-negotiable,” he once said. Perhaps it is that underlying ethos, of willingness to sacrifice the self in search of something greater, which binds all of the aforementioned roots, loose philosophical strands that they are, together to form a cohesive philosophy.

Cholismo stands for many things and will continue to grow, the one certainty being that Simeone, laughed at as a boy for his footballing pretensions and criticised as a coach for rejecting the importance of the ball, is his own disciple.

=== Jesús Gil and the story of Spanish football’s own Donald Trump ===

10/20/2016

Picture the scene. A multi-millionaire property developer is sat in a jacuzzi, where he is surrounded by half a dozen bikini-clad women young enough to be his granddaughters as he hosts his egotistical ratings-obsessed TV show. This is simply a brief break from the political career he has just launched and from spouting the misogynistic, xenophobic or otherwise offensive comments the country’s media has come to expect of him.

No, it’s not who you’re thinking of. This is not Donald Trump. This is Gregorio Jesús Gil y Gil, former mayor of Marbella and former president of Atlético Madrid.

The 2016 American presidential race was one if the wackiest elections mankind has known since Napoleon Dynamite boogied Pedro Sánchez to victory over Summer Wheatley in the 2004 film of the same name. Of course, the one reason for the heightened pantomime drama of the race for the White House was the presence of Donald Trump, an outsider to the world of politics and a man who is not afraid to speak his mind. In the American political landscape, he is certainly a novel candidate, but many Spaniards of a certain age will have memories of a similarly eccentric political figure.

Like Trump, Gregorio Jesús Gil y Gil – better known as Jesús Gil – made his fortune in property, but both of the construction tycoons first made the respective national headlines for all the wrong reasons.

In June 1969, a freshly-completed Segovia complex, which had been built by Gil’s company, tragically collapsed, killing 58 people and injuring many more of the 700 guests that had been invited for the evening’s dinner. In the subsequent investigation, it was found that the building had been completed on the back of reckless cost-cutting that included a lack of plans and the failure to consult an architect or surveyor. The cement hadn’t even properly dried and the now-famous Gil was sentenced to five years in prison – although he was eventually pardoned by the dictator Francisco Franco himself after 18 months.

Just four years later in Brooklyn in 1973, Trump also attracted some unwanted national fame with the first of many unfavourable New York Times headlines. While the accusation was not quite as serious as the one of manslaughter attributed to his Spanish construction peer, the “Major Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias in City” headline was a similarly unfortunate way to first grab the population’s attention.

“The government contended that Trump Management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals because of race and colour … and also charged that the company had required different rental terms and conditions because of race and that it had misrepresented to blacks that apartments were not available,” the newspaper said at the time. The dispute was eventually settled in 1975 with an agreement that Trump and his father Fred C. Trump insisted did not signal an admission of guilt, but the bad press generated by the scandal was unwelcome, even if ultimately unfounded.

It wouldn’t take long, though, for both men to restore their national reputations – or rather, to reinvent their reputations, given that neither had had one to lose in the first place – and by the Air Jordans and baggy sweaters end of the 1980s, their respective stocks were – literally and figuratively – on the up.

Just two nights before Atlético Madrid’s 1987 presidential election, Jesús Gil showed up at the capital city’s Jacara club with Porto star Paulo Futre in tow and with a promise that he had an agreement in place with the Portuguese club to sign the player should he win the ballot. His highjacking of Los Rojiblancos’ election proved successful and Gil did indeed defeat his main rival, Enrique Sánchez de León, to the finish line, with 6,219 votes to his name, compared to his opponent’s 3,465.

That marked a clear before and after in the history of Atlético Madrid, a club that would never be the same again. For better and, increasingly often, for worse, Gil altered the club’s course. There was some initial success, with top four finishes in his first five seasons in charge and with Copa del Rey wins in 1991 and 1992, but the president’s off-the-cuff and eccentric demeanour was increasingly turning this distinguished institution into a circus.

jesus-gil-atleticoNot the finest athlete in Spanish football

Then, in 1992, Gil controversially converted Atlético into a ‘Sociedad Anónima Deportiva’ – in English, a Public Limited Sports Company. Like the frog in the simmering pot of water, there was no immediate realisation on the part of the fan base of the seriousness of that corporate restructuring and by the time it became apparent exactly what had happened it was too late.

Gil and his business partner – and current president – Enrique Cerezo were found guilty of having illegally acquired their 236,056 shares in the club, but the statute of limitations had expired by the time this went to court and they were permitted to keep them, with Gil’s son Miguel Ángel Gil Marín still owning – directly and indirectly – over half of the club’s shares today.

As if that theft of their club wasn’t tough enough for fans of Los Colchoneros to come to terms with, in that same year Gil closed the club’s youth academy as a cost-saving measure. As such, a youngster by the name of Raúl switched to their neighbours Real Madrid, and everyone in Spain’s capital city knows how his career turned out.

Across the Atlantic, Trump’s career was following a parallel and similar arc. The 1980s were glory years for the American as well, before his house of cards similarly began to fall apart in the early 1990s.

Trump Tower was the most iconic of the many Trump-backed properties to punctuate the New York City skyline, opening in 1983. A number of other projects then had his name written all over the contracts over the latter half of the decade, with the businessman also heavily involved in the Atlantic City casino boom. Like Gil, he even tried his hand at sports ownership by purchasing the New Jersey Generals American football team and by helping to establish the NFL-competing United States Football League.

Yet, at the same time as Gil was about to muddy his name with the Atlético fan base, four of Trump’s businesses filed for bankruptcy, while the United States Football League project similarly failed. While the ‘he said, she said’ rhetoric of the US election has produced numerous conflicting claims surrounding the bankruptcies of Trump’s businesses, the Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact asserts that The Trump Taj Mahal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1991, before Trump Castle, Trump Plaza and Casino, and Plaza Hotel all did likewise in 1992.

Even though they would both bounce back from these ultimately minor setbacks, it is fair to say that the 1990s did not get off to a particularly great start for either man on the business front. Yet, for Gil his political career was contrastingly flying at the time.

Trump may have held off on his political career until now, but there was no such waiting around for Gil when it came to running for public office – one of very few forks in the shared road that their careers appeared to be following.

In 1991, he founded the far-right-wing political party Grupo Independiente Liberal – with its comically brazen abbreviation of GIL – and was elected to the office of the mayor of Marbella later that year, winning two-thirds of the vote as GIL won 19 of the council’s 25 seats. He may have been positively daft but at least he was positive, and the fact he was unconventional was a breath of fresh air to some voters.

Had Trump had an interest in 1990s Costa del Sol politics (and who’s to say that he didn’t?) then he would surely have been inspired by Gil’s campaign. Not only did the Spaniard whack the capital letters of his own surname onto a political party – something you suspect Trump would like to do himself given his tendency to use his surname as branding for everything from steaks to airlines – but he was elected on a platform of restoration. The slogan may as well have been ‘Make Marbella Great Again’ as Gil promised to restore the once-glamorous seaside city to its former glory by driving out the unwanted ‘others’. Swap illegal immigrants and Muslims for prostitutes and the homeless and Gil’s vision for making Marbella safer was just one giant wall short of fitting in at a Trump rally.

While it remains to be seen whether – and how – Trump will actually keep his campaign promises, Gil did manage to stick to his. Under his leadership, crime rates and poverty indicators did fall to some degree with the deportation of foreigners, the bribing of homeless people to switch towns and alleged violence against prostitutes in order to disperse them like a kit of pigeons.

Of course, such a harsh application of law and order could never be carried out in a pleasant manner, but it was made even worse by Gil’s offensive comments as he wandered the streets shouting abuse at prostitutes – which was ironic as he had worked as a brothel’s accountant as a young man – while he also labelled a female political rival as a “whore” during his lively mayorship.

That behaviour, coupled with the fact that he installed a bust of Franco in the town hall, sparked plenty of controversy and more than 100 complaints against the Marbella police force, but – just as Trump is finding in modern day America – large swathes of the Marbella population had no problem with an improvement in the local area coming at the potential expense of the civil liberties of the perceived ‘others’.

As such, Gil was re-elected three more times and remained popular with his core voters throughout his time in office. Concurrently, he even earned nationwide fame for his entertaining Atlético-related comments – having promised to shoot players with a machine gun, having been filmed asking his horse’s advice on whether or not to sack a coach, having sent referees gifts of lingerie before matches, having celebrated a double win by riding the Madrid streets on an elephant and having consistently goaded city rivals Real Madrid – and for his tacky-but-fun TV show ‘Las Noches De Tal Y Tal’, which he presented from the aforementioned jacuzzi.

He soon set his sights on the highest position in the land, insisting that “I want to become the Prime Minister of the Spanish government in order to clean up Spain”, but his political ambitions were soon stopped in their tracks. In October 1998, anti-corruption lawyers raided the Marbella town hall and the Atlético Madrid offices at the Vicente Calderón as they investigated the alleged funnelling of taxpayers’ money into the capital city football club in the famous ‘Caso Camisetas’ – the football shirt case, in which the municipality of Marbella was found to have been a sham sponsor of the Atlético shirts.

As a result of his subsequent 28-year ban from holding public office, in April 2002 Gil had to stand down from his position as mayor, although he would maintain control for a short while afterwards via proxies.

It wasn’t a complete death sentence to his political party but GIL would never be the same again without its determined leader at the helm. Until the court sentences against him, the party had been prospering, having expanded to put candidates in place for elections in another 12 municipalities on the Costa del Sol. “It was to this success that Gil later ascribed his downfall,” The Telegraph would explain in their obituary of the man. “[He believed] that the politicians in Madrid had become fearful lest he use his wealth and popularity to run for higher office, as Silvio Berlusconi had done in Italy.”

jesus gilJesús Gil

The implication was that his political success had encouraged fellow politicians and the media to scrutinise his past dealings in a way that they never would have done had he not become a threat. Of course, he himself was the main reason his past discretions became a problem as it was he who did all of the things he was accused of. Yet there is also some validity to the Scooby Doo-esque idea that he ‘would have gotten away with it too if it weren’t for the ‘meddlin’ media’ – an idea that Trump has similarly tried to peddle in the current election.

In the end, with further legal issues in the post, the loved and loathed Jesús Gil passed away at 71-years-old in May 2004. He passed on a legacy of ridiculously admirable cockiness, while also far more seriously leaving behind a reputation for violence, racism, homophobia, sexism and corruption. 

Spain never expected to see anyone quite like him ever again and, spooling forward 12 years, Spain so far has not. Anyone currently living in the USA, however, can hardly turn on a TV screen without seeing their own version of Jesús Gil.

The similarities between Gil’s political rhetoric and that of Trump are uncanny, but some would call them chilling. There are a number of trivial resemblances between these two outspoken property tycoons who went on to become celebrity politicians full of razzmatazz, but there are also some far more serious correlations that anyone looking towards the municipality of Marbella or to Atlético Madrid SAD – as the club is now, as a result of Gil, legally known – would be wise to take notice of.

In the case of Marbella and in the case of Atlético Madrid, many voters cast their ballot for Gil blind to the fact that they were voting for a con-artist. He may have had some minor successes in those institutions, but he ran them both like a kid’s lemonade stand and left them in a dire state.

Marbella kicked out its vilified poor, homeless, prostitutes and immigrants, but opened its doors to the organised crime gangs of the rest of Europe and quickly became a party town for wealthy criminals, contributing to the Costa del Crime nickname. Financially, the City Council became a disaster and, just four years after Gil stood down, the Spanish government took the unprecedented step of suspending the Marbella City Council and sending in a team of auditors to fix the mess.

Atlético, meanwhile, suffered the only relegation in its post-war history under Gil’s tenure as he overspent in areas where it wasn’t necessary, while underspending where it ultimately hurt. The club was able to recover and climb back into La Liga, but not without accumulating a mountain of debt. Los Rojiblancos still, as a result of that tumultuous period, owe money to the Spanish taxman, with €45 million not yet paid back.

Nobody knows what Donald Trump’s USA would look like. Yet all Americans will be hoping that this is the point where Gil and Trump’s parallel career paths separate. Those who voted for him will be optimistic that his presidency will not produce the kind of difficulties – but on a macro scale – that Marbella and Atlético experienced after Gil, while those that vote against him obviously hope that he doesn’t get into power at all.

When you look at it that way, the USA is fairly unanimous in agreement. Some Americans want Trump, but no sensible American would want him to be their Jesús Gil.


=== How to become a legend: Why sales of Juanfran's shirt have skyrocketed ===

Atleti's right back is emblematic of the team's spirit and his standing has only improved since that night at San Siro

Matthias Hangst/Getty Images
(The following is a special column from guest author Dave Kerr. Follow him on Twitter @Dave_llb.)

I didn’t see it. I never do. My habit during penalty shootouts is to look at the floor. The first I knew it had happened was my friend saying "he’s missed." I didn’t even know who it was at first. I knew I wouldn’t blame him though, whoever it was. The team who took the field in Milan shares well over 1000 appearances for Atlético Madrid. Diego Godín, Koke, Fernando Torres, Gabi and, of course, Juanfran have defended Atlético’s colours in more than 250 matches. Not far behind are Filipe Luís and Tiago with over 200. Each had played their part in bringing us to this point and if anything had earned the right to be forgiven for a mistake. There was every chance that I would look up at the screen to find that a bonafide club legend had missed the crucial kick.

It was Juanfran. Juanfran, the hero of the crazy 8-7 shootout v PSV in the last 16. His penalty had put Atltico through after 120 goalless minutes with the Dutch champions. His strike to the bottom-left corner of Jeroen Zoet’s goal sparked scenes of jubilation as Simeone raced from the dugout and the fans erupted. Juanfran, not a man accustomed to scoring goals, far less crucial ones, charged around shirtless. A stalwart servant had finally gotten his moment of glory…but the cruelty of Milan made it seem such a distant memory.

Juanfran’s journey: from Real to Atleti
Juanfran actually began his career at Real Madrid. After only six games he was transferred to Osasuna with Real retaining a buy back option. A series of fiery games against his former club soured his relationship with them and his 30-yard strike against them kept Osasuna in the top flight. Juanfran was signed by Atlético from Osasuna in January 2011, just in time to enjoy a dismal run of two wins from in 11 games (including four defeats on the spin in January). Signed as a winger, he joined Atleti in the same window as the forgettable Elias, although this was the season that Godín, Filipe, Koke and Diego Costa joined or became part of the first team at the Vicente Calderón.

Just 9 months earlier Atleti had won the Europa League, the club’s first trophy since 1996, but the club still seemed on a downward trajectory. It’s fair to say that capture of a journeyman winger for €3m from Osasuna hardly set pulses racing among the Atlético faithful; a quick glance at the Colchonero.com forum from the time shows as much.

The Europa League victory was supposed to be a springboard yet manager Quique Sanchez Flores had, by this point, fallen out with the club’s talismanic, Europa League-winning, Golden Boot-winning striker Diego Forlán and was struggling to keep the club in the Europa League places. His managerial reign would have been over midway through the season, like so many before him, if he didn’t have the Europa League and Super Cup goodwill to fall back on.

Flores’ replacement, Gregorio Manzano, was equally uninspired. Manzano returned at the start of Juanfran’s first full season with the club and proceeded to fall out with José Antonio Reyes, arguably the club’s best player and competitor for Juanfran’s right wing slot. (In fairness, the first thing Simeone did was bin the ex-Arsenal man so… y’know…).  Poor results followed and Manzano’s reign was inconsistent, to say the least. Safe to say, Juanfran found it hard shine in such a team. Despite the recruitment of Radamel Falcao, Diego Ribas, Arda Turan, Miranda and Thibaut Courtois, all of whom later acquitted themselves with distinction under Simeone, the club failed to pick up any points on the road under Manzano and dropped plenty at home too. Manzano was put out of his misery in late December after an abject Cup loss in the Calderón against Albacete (also known as "ALBA-F*CKING-CETE?!" in my house). Perhaps a sign of just how bad Manzano was is the fact that the entire back four including Juanfran (as well as Koke and Gabi in central midfield) who lost to Albacete would go on to win the league, the Copa and (with the exception of Miranda, who left in 2015) play in two Champions League finals.

Then, scarcely a year after signing, Juanfran’s life – and that of every other Rojiblanco – was to change completely. The appointment of Diego Pablo "Cholo" Simeone as manager was to turn both the club and Juanfran’s fortunes around. No other manager in Atlético’s history had turned the club’s fortunes around like he would – and perhaps no other manager in the history of football has accomplished what he has, either.

But in 2012, Juanfran was a bit player under Manzano and was behind Silvio and Perea for a starting spot. After Simeone took over, Juanfran featured at right back in all but one of the remaining league games that season under Simeone. Cholo clearly recognised the doggedness, reliability and mental strength that would make Juanfran a League and Cup champion in years to come. The erstwhile winger featured in all but one of the Europa League matches as Atlético went on to lift the trophy, comprehensively beating Athletic Club 3-0 in Bucharest. Poignantly, he dedicated that win to his late father:

My baby son Oliver is here with me; the only words he knows are 'mama' and 'Atleti,' I dedicate this win to my family and to my dad, who passed away last year. I know he's up there looking down on us celebrating now.

 
Denis Doyle/Getty Images
His son would go on to figure largely in Juanfran’s story. In fact, little Oliver has been a fixture at Atlético for almost as long as his father. The images that most stick in the mind of the Copa del Rey celebrations are of Juanfran junior, front and centre, clutching his father’s miniature replica trophy. In that match, his father’s crucial goal-line clearance from a Mesut Özil attempt at an unguarded net had given Atleti the belief to go on and win the trophy. Now older, young Oli is one of Atleti’s chief cheerleaders.

These days, Juanfran is one of the first names on the teamsheet. He plays as a swashbuckling full back, equally at home busting out some winger stylings as harrying an opponent outside his own box. Never one to dive into tackles, Juanfran’s pace, cool head and dedication to his task make him the perfect Simeone disciple. His overlapping runs, touch, and close control make him a supplementary winger and his pace and doggedness get him back into position in time. Never really a goal threat, he does chip in with his fair share of assists and creates on average a chance a game from crosses.

Juanfran stands apart as a footballer in the modern era. Unusually skinny for a footballer, he shuns the ubiquitous tattoo sleeves and somehow manages to have an unfashionable beard in the era of the Hipster. He personifies the term "stalwart." Everything about him is unflashy but reliable - from his positional sense to his haircut. He’s always there when you need him - his 258 matches put him in the club’s top-30 all-time appearances list after five and a half seasons. He’s averaged 48 games a season in this time and he has played in 140 league games out of 152 in the last four years.

Why do we love Juanfran so much? Well, the club’s identity is working class. The very tenets of Cholismo & Atletismo are built on sacrifice, humility, relentless effort and selflessness. Juanfran is the very embodiment of these tenets. There are plenty of wingers who would have gone in a sulk if they were repurposed as a fullback. Not Juanfran. He knuckled down to become first choice for club and country.

An odd-man-out, a misfit, a man who has to work for his rewards and a man who’s been swept along on the tide of Cholismo just as much as the next Colchonero.
But, first and foremost, he’s a family man. He goes out to earn a living for his family first and then to do right by the Rojiblanco faithful. This isn’t some €50m, narcissistic, post-Beckham, tattooed walking haircut with no connection to the club. This is someone who represents the majority of fans. Those same fans have taken him to their hearts. We’ve watched his son grow and he’s been with us from the lowest of ebbs to the highest of highs. An odd-man-out, a misfit, a man who has to work for his rewards and a man who’s been swept along on the tide of Cholismo just as much as the next Colchonero. That’s Juanfran. That’s Atlético.

Heartbreak in Milan
He put his penalty in the same corner as he did against PSV. Just a little too far this time. The tiniest fraction to the right would have seen it go in. After the game, Juanfran was disconsolate. So was Oli. Both were in bits leaving the stadium. Meanwhile, our illustrious rivals (arch predators of the misery of others) celebrated with Richard F*cking Gere.

It’s a strange thing to do, forgiving the guy who has cost your team the ultimate prize in football. But in Juanfran, we see ourselves. We see where hard work can take you. We see a man who wears his heart on his sleeve. When he missed, we didn’t think less of him. We loved him more. As he asked forgiveness, we saw our pain magnified and reflected back at us. We didn’t look in anger, we looked on in sympathy for the burden he has to carry. His miss forced us to confront what it means to be Atleti fans, how and why we feel the way we do about our club and to evaluate just what Juanfran represents and what he (and the rest of this squad, it has to be said) mean to the club. Do we support Atleti because they win trophies? No. Do we support a club that ships in expensive mercenaries? No. Would we want to? Are doubles and trebles the be-all and end-all, or is it more important to stand for something? Is the loss of one trophy really worth turning against a fantastic and loyal servant?

And, if his prayer for forgiveness wasn’t enough, he issued an open letter the next day thanking the fans for their support and promising to return to lift the trophy. His heartfelt letter summed up the bond between the players and the support. Indeed, so strong is the connection between the club, manager and fans that we feel more a part of the collective than mere supporters or, as the modern parlance has it "consumers." The success of Simeone’s Atlético is the success of the unbreakable connection between fan, club, player and manager that he has fostered. Our success hasn’t come via a Chinese billionaire’s conceit, an Oligarch’s avarice or an Emir’s ego. It is the result of work, belief, passion and sacrifice – on the part of both fans and players. No one personifies this more than the dogged rightback guy who has gone from the fringes to the trenches under our manager.

Small wonder then that sales of his shirt have skyrocketed. In that one moment, the fine line between effort and reward, between luck and misfortune and between justice and cruelty was exposed. And you know what? We wouldn’t have it any other way. I’d rather lose ten finals with men like Juanfran than win one with Cristiano Ronaldo, a mishmash of mercenary "Galacticos" and Richard Bloody Gere.

Had Juanfran missed for Real, he’d have been whistled all the way from Milan to Madrid. And that’s the difference.

I love you Juanfran and AÚPA ATLETI!

=== The evolution of Atlético Madrid ===
BundesPremierLeagueTeam FeatureThe evolution of Atlético Madrid
 
Atlético Madrid are undoubtedly the talk of the town that is European football, having progressed through the Champions League final after ousting the Bayern and Barcelona juggernauts. Diego Simeone’s team will face Real Madrid in the May 28th final, a team they are one point ahead of in La Liga. If Barcelona were to slip up in their final two games, Atlético, who are only second on goal difference to the Catalans, could even win the title. At this point, having seen the predatory instincts of this team, one would be wise to think about betting on them. But just how did they get here? This article will examine the evolution of Atlético Madrid, going from the other Madrid team to the one that has become a thorn in the side of European giants.

Growing up and watching Spanish football in the 90s Atlético Madrid were always an amusing team. First of all, it was never easy for people to tell them apart from Athletic Bilbao – the Madrid club was founded by three Basque students who simply just changed the name and the location to their residence in the capital city. Joining La Liga in the inaugural 1928 season, the club found little success until after the second World War, when under Helenio Herrera (the founder of Catenaccio and later the manager of the great Inter teams of the 60s) the club won two La Liga titles in 1950 and 51. While Real dominated the league from the fifties to the eighties – winning 17 titles in 27 years –  Atlético  was arguably their biggest challenger, actually winning four championships compared to Barcelona’s three in that span. The Luis Aragones years ((1974 to 1980, 1982 to 1987) brought only Cup titles, and in 1987 the club got a new owner, the notorious Jesus Gil y Gil , a man with the bravado and right-wing populism that matched that of AC Milan’s Silvio Berlusconi. While Gil’s political career only made it to the mayor of Marbella, his outbursts were legendary and his quotes would have absolutely blown up all of social media had he not died in 2004 at the age of 71. Here are a couple from the excellent obituary by the Telegraph:

1. Gil celebrated this last triumph by bathing in champagne and parading through Madrid on a white horse. “With my popularity,” he told reporters, “I could be God.”

2.”Players? My mistake was to treat them like people. My horses are more intelligent.”

3. “In 15 years he changed managers 40 times, and worked his way through six in 1993 alone.”

Closing down the club’s academy in 1992 and thus forcing then 15-year-old Raul to make the switch to Real Madrid was also not one of his better ideas.

So, while Radomir Antic finally took them to the promised land – winning the double in 1995/96 –  the Gil era was often a train wreck and  by the end of the 90s the club was 300m Euros in debt and relegated to the Segunda division. Under the stewardship of Luis Aragones, a former player and managing the club for the fourth time in  2002/03 they returned to top flight football, and while talents such as Fernando Torres were developed as recently as 2009, the club was described as “the worst run in Europe” by La Liga expert Sid Lowe. Aside from that title, the 90s and the 2000s saw Atlético being passed by better-run and managed teams such as La Coruna, Valencia and Sevilla.

Ironically, in that same year the club’s fortune has started to turn around and under Quique Sánchez Flores in 2009/10 a Europa League title thanks to Diego Forlan’s two goals, and a European Super Cup titled followed suit. A disappointing campaign next year under Flores and a quick hook on Gregorio Manzano meant that by the end of 2011 Atlético – keeping with the tradition of employing ex-players as managers – had hired Diego Simeone . The Argentine had played over 125 games for the club in two stints and was just cutting his teeth as a coach,  famously delivering the first Argentinean title in 23 years to Estudiantes.  The rest, as they say is history: In 2012, they would win the Europa League and the European Super Cup again, while the next year saw them overcome Real Madrid to lift the Spanish Cup. Simeone’s squad in the 2013/14 season took La Liga with a record 90 points and was moments away from lifting the Champions League – until a 93rd minute equalizer saw their dreams crushed by Real Madrid. Last season’s Barca juggernaut ran rougshod over everyone in the world and Atlético were no exception, getting eliminated by Luis Enrique’s team in the Copa del Rey and La Liga, while Real knocked them out via one goal in the UCL quarter finals. In the 2015/16 season, Atlético have of course slayed Barca and Bayern and were still alive for the La Liga title, level on points with Barcelona (both have identical records of 36 matches played, 27 wins, 4 losses and 5 draws) with two matches to go, until a shocking 2-1 loss to Levante on matchday 37 undid those hopes.

Regardless of that loss, it’s been a massive campaign for Simeone’s men, but how have they done it? Let’s examine five reasons for Atlético’s recent success, such as 1. the solid financial and ownership background, 2. player development ,3. successful transfers, 4. managerial improvement and 5. tactics

1. Usually, when one talks of a stable financial background there are thoughts of billionaire investors who like knights in shining armors come in and rescue a struggling team from the claws of bankruptcy straight to the safety of the Champions League in a modern romantic fairytale. Popularizing that narrative would be simply disingenuous in the case of Atlético, as  Peter Staunton’s article brilliantly shows on Goal.com.

“By 2011 they owed a scarcely conceivable €517 million (£424.3m) to creditors – including as much as €171m (£140.3m) to the tax authorities alone. The Spanish government could have done more to call in the debt instead of offering Atlético a favourable rate of 4.5 per cent interest per annum while they paid off €15m (£12.3m) of their tax bill every year” meaning that “perversely, the economic meltdown in Spain, where unemployment stands at around 26%, gave Atlético the opportunity to alleviate their own predicament.”

Oh wait, that is exactly the modern American bailout fairytale if you are a banker or a financial institution a la Goldman Sachs.

Then came the sponsorship deals with Azerbaijan -12 million a season from a notoriously repressive and authoritarian country led by Ilham Aliyev – which were slammed by most human rights organizations. That was followed by the investments of China’s richest man – Wang Jianlin paid 45 million for a 20% share in 2015. This is not meant to pass judgment on Atlético, since it’s precisely what big clubs like the aforementioned slain giants in Munich and Barcelona do with Qatar. It’s basically a necessity in modern football, and the following three images provide some context on where Atlético ranks.

A. TV money from Europe’s five biggest leagues – Due to the Premier League’s dominance, you can see why teams like Bayern or Atlético would need to seek out sponsors.

B. In terms of total revenue, Atlético have increased 10%, but are still substantially behind those big Bundesliga clubs like Dortmund or Schalke, despite virtually identical TV money.

C. The gap between Atlético and the Barca/Real duo remains enormous when it comes to budgets.laligabudget2014

http://en.classora.com/reports/x172914/ranking-of-spains-first-division-soccer-league-teams-by-budget

2. Bridging such a huge gap on the field needs some competitive advantage, usually in the form of player development, scouting/transfers and coaching. The Atlético academy, once infamously being shut down by Gil and losing Raul has churned out some excellent players over the years, as this Outside of the Boot article explains:  Fernando Torres and David de Gea need little introduction, while Koke, Gabi and Saul Niguez have become household names and the stuffs of nightmares to Bayern and Barca fans, but even Alvaro Morata and Mario Suarez have found relative success. The future is also bright with youngsters like Oliver Torres – linked with Dortmund for a while – or Lucas Hernandez who started against Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final in April.

3. The list of players who became world-class in Madrid is equally impressive and the scouting department of the club deserves heaps of praise. A quick glance at Transfermarkt shows that the club has made 30 million on two homegrown players in de Gea and 18.75 million  on Torres. Meanwhile the sales of acquired players such as Diego Costa netted 28 million, in addition to Sergio Aguero and Arda Turan who brought in 15 million each.. Falcao was their biggest signing and aside from enjoying his finest hours with the club, they were able to profit 3 million on the Colombian’s move to Chelsea. They’ve also spent that money wisely on young rising stars, such as Real Sociedad’s Antoine Griezmann, who has since doubled his 22 million price. Their best move has been splurging on defenders, as this following image from the 2010/11 arrivals shows atl201011

 

That is 75% of their starting defense now valued at 49 million, plus Koke, who is now valued at 37 million and Diego Costa, who they sold for nearly 30 million. JEEZ!

 

 

 

Miranda and Gabi cost them 2 million the next year, and while the Brazilian was loaned to Inter for 3 million and will transfer for over 8, the Spaniard, returning to his original club from Zaragoza has been invaluable in midfield ever since. Gabi is just one of those boomerang players, who Atlético, particulary under Simeone have been excellent at refurbishing into effective pieces. Fernando Torres’ renaissance is probably the most surprising for English fans, but Filipe Luis’ resurgence is a close second, as the Brazilian went from one of the best left backs to Chelsea bust to arguably the best left back in the game (David Alaba is still looking for his ankles after what Saul and Torres had done to him) in a couple of years.

Such has been their brilliance that even their mistakes, such as losing Alderweireld to Southampton, or signing Jackson Martinez and Pizzi still netted them profits of 10 million pounds combined. Mario Mandzukic was their only notable player they sold at a 2 million loss to Juventus.

The last remarkable sidenote and the culmination of scouting, development and transfer policy is their unprecedented trio of goalkeepers, de Gea, Courtois (on loan from Chelsea) and Jan Oblak.

4. Comparisons of Diego Simeone to Jose Mourinho have often been made and in the dichotomy of tiki/taka offensive football, the Argentine and the Portuguese have emerged as natural villains to the Barca/Bayern/Madrid trio and Guardiola. Simeone, who like Mourinho embraces this role of villain, with nicknames like “El Cholo” (roughly meaning hick/country bumpkin) and “the man in black” has quickly reached cult status among football aficionados and players and with quotes like this it is easy to see why:

“I always ask my players, what kind of season do you prefer? One where you play all the matches, but you finish lower on the table and out of all major competitions? Or do you prefer to play 20 matches out of a total of 38, score 8 goals, and the team is crowned a champion? It never fails. They always choose the second option. ”

His no-nonsense attitude as a player, bordering on dirty play has successfully translated into a managerial style that focuses on motivation and team spirit, with words like warrior, underdog and heart seemingly unavoidable in articles written about him. Getting veteran players like Gabi, Juanfran or Diego Godin to buy into his system of defense first football (conceding just 16 goals in 36 matches in the league) has been his calling card, but his trust in youngsters like Saul, Lucas or Stefan Savic needs to be mentioned as well. Cycling through six or seven forwards from David Villa, Mandzukic, Falcao, Costa, Torres and Griezmann and getting key goals and consistent performances from them is another great accomplishment for the coach, while cajoling solid minutes out of washed-up players like Diego (remember this goal ) and the artist formerly known as Martin Demichelis is pure Melisandre Game of Thrones level sorcery.

5. The Mourinho 2.0 version applies even more so to his tactics, which has a couple of key elements, laid out in this extensive piece by the Inside Channel’s Jake Meador. Getting almost everyone behind the ball has been a calling card of the Special One’s Inter teams that Simeone has mastered, as you can see from this image.atletico-defending-attacking-third

His team patiently sits deep in a horizontally and vertically compact formation and like a chess-playing predator pounces when the moment strikes, as the opponent makes a tactical error:

Lazy pundits will often refer to this as parking the bus, but in reality there’s an enormous amount of calculated risk-taking and intelligent defending that goes into such a playing style. For more on how Simeone built the world’s best defense, I recommend Tom Payne’s excellent breakdown of the Bayern match, and Thore Haugstad’s Leicester – Atlético article from February.

Fundamentally, Atlético are happy to concede meaningless possession to the likes of Barca, Bayern and Real all the way up to their 18 yard box because as long as they keep their shapes, those passes are largely irrelevant. That can be enormously frustrating for even great Barca stars,  who were constantly frustrated by getting double-teamed and pressed in the wide areas – another Simeone specialty. Observe:

atletico-pressing-wide-areas

Jürgen Klopp’s famous counter or Gegenpressing strategy has also rubbed off on Simeone as noted soccer statistician Michael Caley explains in his Washington Post article:cl_final_counterpress_league

“This seems to create an opportunity. Atlético Madrid is a team that thrives in transition: its late back-breaking goals against Barcelona and Bayern came from fast counterattacks. In La Liga, Simeone’s side has created 38 shots from very direct attacks, second most in the league after Barcelona.”

That sort of press, aside from being an effective offense unto itself also frustrates, not just strikers, but even the best passers, as Jerome Boateng found out famously on the Griezmann goal, as he compounded the error of his bad pass by foolishly pressing up on Gabi.



The final weapon in Simeone’s repertoir is being adaptable: not adhering to any one school of thought, the Argentine rather focuses on making small adjustments from match to match or even within a match. Here is an example of an in-game change.

This quote from a WorldSoccertalk article explains that “Match-by-match” means no fixed idea or strategy but rather adapting to changes that come into play. Similarly, Simeone takes the same stance when deciding his starting eleven.“I don’t want players who want to be the main characters. If you don’t give it your all and I can feel it, someone else will take your place. Nothing is guaranteed, and if you fall asleep, you’re out.”

So, after all that should we be surprise that Simeone had the following reply when asked about his style:

=== Soccer authorities have slapped a one-month ban on Dr.... ===
Feb. 28, 1981	 

MADRID -- Soccer authorities have slapped a one-month ban on Dr. Alfonso Cabeza, the outspoken young president of league leader Atletico Madrid, for comments made in a Barcelona discoteque earlier this year.

Cabeza may appeal the decision.

In his discotque appearance, which he said at the time was meant only for 'people who have had a drink or two,' Cabeza made derogatory comments about a soccer referee, cross-town rival Real Madrid and Barcelona coach Helenio Herrera.

He spoke as the 'man of the month' of the discoteque, one of Barcelona's most popular clubs.

The volatile Cabeza has made a new team out of Atletico this year, pushing it to the top of the league with large injections of morale and money.

He resigned his job as head of La Paz, Madrid's biggest hospital, late last year after colleagues said the publicity he received was bad for them.


=== A Season in the Spotlight – La Liga 1970-71 ===
by Chris Clements | Posted on Saturday, March 10th, 2012
Background – La Primera title had not left Madrid for a decade, with either Real Madrid (8) or Atlético Madrid (2) winning the league throughout the sixties. Barcelona was the last side from outside of the capital to win the league, but the sixties was a barren period for the blaugranas, as they struggled with the financial constraints brought about from building the Camp Nou. The fans of Valencia had not seen their team win the league since 1947 and whilst the club had won two Fairs Cups and the Copa del Generalísimo in recent years, it was the league title that Los Ches coveted. However, as the season wore on, it appeared that this was a title that nobody wanted to win.

24 year wait is over
The Story of the Campaign – After finishing fifth in the two previous campaigns, Valencia surprised the Spanish game by appointing Real Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stéfano as coach in the close season. He had returned to Argentina in 1967 and guided Boca Juniors to the league title. However, a slow start to the season left Valencia in mid-table and by week four, Champions Atlético sat at the head of the table. Over the next twelve weeks, Los Colchoneros and a resurgent Barcelona swapped places at the top the league on no fewer than nine occasions. Meanwhile, Valencia was developing a head of steam and victories over Atlético and Barcelona saw them close the gap at the top. A win at home to Granada and surprise defeats on the road for Atlético & Barcelona, saw Valencia hit the top for the first time in week 19. Here Los Ches stayed until an untimely 0-3 defeat at the Calderon, saw Atlético return to the top in week 24. A week later and Valencia hit the top again with a 4-0 thumping of Athletic. The run in was a tight affair with the top three all gaining maximum points, until a costly 0-0 draw at Malaga in the penultimate week, saw Atlético drop to third, a point behind Barcelona and two behind leaders Valencia. Valencia knew that if they avoided defeat in the final match at Espanyol, they would be champions. Any slip up, and the winners of the Atlético – Barcelona fixture would be crowned champions.

Face-off – The title would be decided at the Vicente Calderon or Estadi Sarria
Significant Matches – The Spanish football nation held its breath on Sunday 18 April 1971 and awaited the climax of the season. Half-time came and went with both ties scoreless, then both matches burst into life around the hour-mark. First Dueñas put the Catalans ahead in Madrid, but four minutes later substitute Luis equalised for Atlético. Then, dramatically, Valencia fell behind at Sarria, when Lamata scored for Espanyol in the 65th minute. A win for either team at the Calderon would see one of them crowned champions at Valencia’s expense. All three teams seemed paralysed with fear, as news of each other’s matches filtered through and mistakes started to litter both ties. In the end it was Atlético’s and Barcelona’s fear of losing the match that cost them both the title. A 1-1 draw did either no favours and despite the loss, Valencia’s better head-to-head record against Barcelona earned them their first league title in 24 years.

Campeónes – Valancia’s championship winning side of 70-71
Extras – This was the last season that the top flight in Spain would have 16 teams as La Liga was extended to 18 teams for the 1971-72 season. Elche and Real Zaragoza occupied both relegation places from week eleven and ultimately dropped to La Segunda. Barcelona gained some revenge with a 4-3 victory over Valencia in that season’s Copa del Generalísimo.

 
For the Record – Much of European football in the grip of Catenaccio, and Spain was no exception, with a measly 543 goals scored at an average of 2.26 per game. Espanyol was the worst offender scoring a pitiful 18 goals in their 30 fixtures. Reigning champions Atlético Madrid was top goal scorer with 51, but their lack of goals away from home ultimately cost them dearly. If it was pure entertainment you were after, Sporting Gijón was the team to follow, with a total of 79 goals coming in their 30 matches.
 
Pichichi – There was a tie for the Trofeo Pichichi with Atlético’s José Eulogio Gárate & Barcelona’s Carles Rexach level with 17 goals from 28 matches. Gárate was born in Argentina to Basque parents, but returned to Spain when a few months old. Unable to play for Athletic due to his land of birth, he joined SD Eibar as a youth and then Atlético in 1966. He went on to score 109 goals for Los Colchoneros, earning the Pichichi on two other occasions. Winger Carles Rexach is a Barcelona legend, having joined the club from the reserve team, Condal in 1967. Over the next 14 years, Rexach played 328 times for Barça, scoring 84 goals. He finished his playing career in 1981 and spent the next 21 seasons in coaching roles, including first team manager between 2001-02.

Gárate &  Rexach could not be separated
Zamora – Asturian born Ángel Abelardo González played in all of Valencia’s 30 league matches and conceded just 19 goals. He had joined the club in 1964 from UP Langreo, but was only made first choice keeper following Di Stéfano’s arrival. His performances for Los Ches earned him a place in the national squad, but he never played an international match. He finished his career back in Asturias with Sporting Gijón before joining the coaching staff at Valencia.


In safe hands – Zamora winner Abelardo
The Clubs Today – Eleven of the sixteen participants appear in this season’s La Liga, whilst Real Zaragoza, CE Sabadell, Las Palmas and Sporting Gijón currently turn out in La Segunda. Alas, CD Malaga, who finished the season in ninth place did not stand the test of time, folding with severe financial problems in 1992.

The Vicente Calderón Stadium is the home stadium of La Liga football club Atlético Madrid and is located in the Arganzuela district of Spanish capital Madrid. The stadium was originally called the Manzanares Stadium, but this was later changed to the Vicente Calderón Stadium, after the famous Atlético club president. The seats are laid out in red and white stripes, the colours of Atlético's shirts. The stadium is located in the heart of Madrid, on the banks of the Manzanares.
Vicente Calderón regularly hosts international matches of the Spanish national team. Since 2003, the Vicente Calderón stadium has been classified as a 5 Star UEFA Elite stadium, and was the first Spanish stadium to attain this classification.

  History

On March 17, 1961, Javier Barroso bought land for the construction of a new stadium, replacing the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid, which had begun to reduce in capacity. Thus, in the same year, work began on the new stadium.
To finance the new stadium, Atlético Madrid had to make a debt issue three years previously, in 1958, in the form of mortgage bonds that were underwritten mostly by club shareholders and members, thus contributing their savings to build the stadium.
On October 2, 1966, the Estadio Manzanares was officially inaugurated, with a capacity for 62,000 spectators, in a match against Valencia CF, which ended in a 1-1 draw. This inauguration was the first for a stadium in Spain which had a fully seated capacity. Over time the crowds reduced in number, and hence the capacity was reduced as the stadium was reconstructed accordingly.
On April 16, 1967 the first Madrid derby in the new stadium was held between Atlético and Real Madrid. The match ended in a 2-2 draw.
On July 14, 1971, at a General Meeting, a name change for the stadium was agreed, with the name that was chosen still in use to this day: the Estadio Vicente Calderón (Vicente Calderón Stadium), in honor of the then Club President, Vicente Calderón.
With reconstruction completed, the Vicente Calderón reopened on May 23, 1972, in the presence of the then Head of State of Spain Francisco Franco, The Prince of Asturias Juan Carlos I de Borbón and President of the Parliament, Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel. To mark the reopening, a friendly was held between Spain and Uruguay, ending with a 2-0 Spanish victory. The goals were scored by Oscar Valdez and Jose Eulogio Garate.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the club on June 4, 1980, a ₧ 451,000,000 budget was approved for the refurbishment and reconstruction of the stadium, with a view to being a venue for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Of this amount, 190,000,000 ₧ was set aside by Atlético, while the rest was made up of grants by the Organizing Committee of the FIFA World Cup. The architect for the reconstruction scheme was Juan José Barroso.
At present, the stadium has capacity for 54,960 spectators, and is classified a 5 Star UEFA Elite Stadium, having received the classification in 2003.
A notable, and rather spectacular feature of the Vicente Calderón, is that the M-30 dual carriageway, running from the South Node Segovia Bridge, passes below one of the grandstands.
The Vicente Calderón Stadium has hosted many musical events in recent years. The highest capacity crowd for a concert was set on June 17, 2006, for "The Number 1 out of 40 Concert", commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the radio station "Los 40 Principales". The concert lasted over seven hours, and was host to more than 40 different artists. The stadium has also hosted a concert by the Mexican band RBD.
  Closure

On October 14, 2008, UEFA decided to sanction Atlético Madrid with the temporary closure of the stadium, following incidents in the stands during the October 1 Champions League Group Stage match between Atlético Madrid and Olympique Marseille.
  Future change of venue

On July 30, 2007, Atlético Madrid, the brewer Mahou and Ayuntamiento de Madrid signed an agreement to reclassify the land that is currently occupied by the Vicente Calderón stadium and the Mahou brewery, agreeing that Atlético would move within 3 years to the Madrid Stadium, better known as La Peineta Stadium, which is currently being renovated in preparation for Atlético's tenancy. After reconstruction, La Peineta will hold 73,000 spectators and will feature fully covered stands. After 2016, the stadium will become the property of Atlético Madrid. The Vicente Calderón Stadium will be demolished, and a park will be built in its place, which is to be named the "Park Atlético Madrid". The decision to demolish the stadium was not well received by some of the Atlético fans who were against the relocation of the club, as they considered it to be a bad move if money was not being used to improve the club itself. The protests were led by the Save the Calderon Group and the Atlético Supporters Club: Asociación Señales de Humo.

  Architecture

Vicente Calderón Stadium has a unique architectural layout. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into four main zones: Preference Side, Lateral Side, North Side and South Side.
The Preference Side of the stadium was the last part of the stadium to be completed, in 1972, due to financial troubles suffered by the club during that period and also due to the poor location of the stadium, on the banks of the Manzanares. This is the main hub of the stadium, where the dugouts, changing rooms, press room, Royal Box, VIP boxes, etc. are found. This is the only part of the stadium that has a roof covering the seating, which is held by 22 reinforced concrete beams that protrude from the main structure of the stand. Preference is further divided into several parts: located on the First Floor are the stands, which are the parts closest to the pitch, the main tier, the anteroom, the Box of Honor (The Palco de Honor), the executive boxes, the VIP Grandstand, the VIP seating North and South of the Preference, and more VIP boxes. On the Upper Floor are the Lower and Higher Tiers, the Superior High Tier Boxes, and finally press and media booths.
  Access

The Estadio Vicente Calderón is located in the district ArganzuelaIn Paseo Virgen del Puerto, 67.
The stadium can be accessed via the following bus routes, run by Empresa Municipal de Transportes de Madrid: 17, 18, 23, 34, 35, 36, 50, 56, 116, 118 and 119.
In addition, the stadium can be accessed via the Madrid Metro. The closest stations are: Pirámides Station and Marqués de Vadillo Station, both of which are on Line 5 of the Madrid Metro. [1] [2]

The stadium hosted three games in the 1982 FIFA World Cup (All Round 2, Group D):
France 1 - Austria 0
Austria 2 - Northern Ireland 2
Northern Ireland 1 - France 4

=== Frente Atlético ===

At Atlético Madrid there are organized fan groups since the 60s. The largest group, Frente Atlético, exists since 1982.

For Spanish standards, the Frente people are fond of traveling.

1986 Atlético reached the final of the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup, which took place in Lyon. Frente Atlético organized 20 fan buses. In total there were probably 30,000 Atlético supporters in Lyon and offered a good curve show.

In the 80s Atlético always had a lot of support at the top games.

1988 the President of Atlético Madrid Gil y Gil recognized Frente as the official fan organisation, what gave to the group a boost of a few thousand members.

In the 90s Frente Atlético could organize a trip to almost all away games and show a great presence in the guest block. That was almost a unique feature in Spain.

1991, with the Cup final at the Estadio Bernabéu against Real Mallorca, the fans could register a particular highlight. The team defeated RCD Mallorca and the fans celebrated all night long, first in the stadium of their enemies Real Madrid and then in the fountain Fuente de Neptuno in Madrid. A year later there was even a bigger party, since they could defend the cup against the hated Real Madrid. 5,000 ultras marched to Estadio Santiago Bernabéu and offered inside with 25,000 supporters inside the stadium a great show. All this at the 10th anniversary of the group Frente Atlético.

Politically, there are many members of the Frente who are right. They commit to the Franco regime and therefore they are in fight against autonomy movements (eg, the Basques and Catalans) and left-wing ideology. Especially the hooligans of Atlético are ultra right. They like to use Nazi symbolism and maintain contacts with other right-wing fan groups in Europe. There are regularly clashes with left-wing groups (such Biris Norte of Seville or Herri Norte Taldea from Bilbao).

Friendships
Frente Atlético has got fan friendships with Ruch Chorzow and the Ultra Boys Gijon. In addition, the hooligans have contacts to Düsseldorf, which are maintained with mutual visites.

Rivalries
They maintain hostilities against the local rival Real Madrid and against Athletic Bilbao. Is it against Bilbao, they even collaborate with ultras of Real. For example, in the Cup final in 1985, where the ultras of Real and Atlético hunted the Basques together.

=== Luis Aragones: The Wise Man from Hortaleza ===
Posted on February 2, 2014 by Jimmy Burns
   
Former Spanish national football coach Luis Aragones has died at the age of 75. Eulogies  have poured in from football enthusiasts around the world  for the man who ended La Roja’s 44-year wait for a major international trophy by winning Euro 2008 with exciting style of play.At the weekend  FC Barcelona and Atletico Madrid fans and players were among those who paid tribute to the tough but wise Castilian .

This is an abridged extract from my book on Spanish football La Roja (published in the UK by Simon and Schuster, in the US by Nation Books, and in Spain under the title De Rio Tinto a La Roja by Contra Ediciones.)

By the time of the World Cup in Germany in 2006 Spain had a new coach, Luis Aragones. After the conservatism of Clemente, the tactical cowardice of Camacho, and the lackluster caretaker role played by Inaki Saenz, expectations rose that the Spanish Federation had finally picked on someone who could motivate an emerging generation of players to combine in a team worthy of seriously challenging the best in the world, casting off the demons of the past that had condemned Spain to the status of football’s great underachiever.

Aragones was born three years into the Spanish Civil War in Hortaleza, a small rural Castilian community north east of Madrid in an area held by the Republican forces. During the post-war years, the area was developed into one of the satellite towns that surrounded the capital. Aragones, a heavily built youth with a reputation for speaking his mind and showing leadership in games, began playing with Getafe before joining Real Madrid. However it was at the unpredictable if always entertaining Atletico de Madrid that he spent the longest time (1964-74), sharing a pichichi in 1970 as one of La Liga’s top scorers, and reaching the European Cup final in 1974 before losing the championship to Bayern Munich.

Aragones came to the job of national coach with a track record as one of the best-known names in Spanish football, thanks to his involvement, often successful, as player and later coach in a variety of Spanish clubs including FC Barcelona. The sheer scope of his experience meant that Aragones over the years came to acquire a rich knowledge of the full potential of Spanish football, the varying styles and strategies of individual clubs, identifying what he thought worked best, and keeping a keen eye on emerging talent.

 Those who appreciated Aragones came to see him as a major football ‘mind’ and dubbed him El Sabio de Hortaleza, the wiseman from Hortaleza. There was talk of him becoming coach in the 1980’s. That the Spanish Federation delayed his appointment was partly due to Aragones’s reputation as a man with a somewhat manic psychological side to him and a tendency to buckle under pressure.  In 1988, while serving as a coach at FC Barcelona Aragones had shown his weakness when the club was confronted with an unprecedented players’ rebellion during which the seamier side of Spanish football had surfaced. The prelude to the rebellion was a rare investigation by Spain’s tax inspectors into the complex arrangements Barca had conspired to keep its foreign players in particular well remunerated.

The investigation, which surfaced after Terry Venables had left for Tottenham and Aragones had taken over as caretaker manager, initially found that the German international Bernd Schuster had signed two contracts with the Catalan club, although only one had been declared to the tax authorities. Further probes uncovered similar tax avoidance deals involving other players, including elaborate payments to offshore companies, designed to minimize the amount of tax they had to pay on their earnings. When the club was ordered to pay to the Spanish Inland Revenue what was owed, the president Jose Luis Nunez passed the bill onto the players.

The reaction of the players was swift and very public. They called a press conference in Barcelona’s Hotel Heredia pointing out that the double contracts had been drawn with the club’s full approval and encouragement, and that it was therefore the club’s responsibility to make provision for the loss. In what came to be known as the ‘Mutiny of Heredia’, the players issued a joint statement. “Nunez has deceived us as individuals and humiliated us as professionals,” the statement declared. One of the Barca players absent on the day was Gary Lineker who was away on call-up duty for the England squad and who felt he had nothing to gain from being associated with the row. “You just couldn’t imagine such a mutiny taking place in England, the fans just wouldn’t buy it, “Lineker told me when we discussed the incident.

 Aragones decided to get involved, and suffered as a result. During a pre-match strategy meeting with the players, Aragones broke down in tears, the stress of managing one of the biggest clubs in the world exacerbated by the strained relationship between the team and the president. The mutiny eventually fizzled out with the players failing to secure the support of the fans, and the club engaging in some imaginative accounting. Then Nunez delivered a master-stroke by bringing back to Barca, as Aragones’s replacement, the one person who seemed to be able to guarantee the success and spectacle that so many Barca fans pined for: Johan Cruyff.

As he grew older- and Aragones was one of the oldest characters in modern Spanish football-his love of the game came to sustain him as he struggled with his weakness for drinking and gambling and falling into dark moods. In October 2004, Aragones was embroiled in a public controversy of a distasteful kind when a Spanish TV crew filmed him coaching Jose Antonio Reyes with a reference to the Spanish wing forward’s Arsenal team mate Thierry Henry. Aragones was heard shouting: “Tell that negro de mierda that black shit that you are better than him. Don’t hold back, tell him. Tell him from me. You have to believe in yourself, you’re better than that negro de mierda.”

The comments caused a wave of protest in the British media and caused some consternation elsewhere in the football world, although within Spain the media’s reaction was generally muted. Aragones himself was unapologetic for an offence he claimed not to have committed, insisting he had a “very easy conscience.” In comments that echoed the less diplomatic period of the Clemente period, Aragones stated: “I’m obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. As part of that job, I use colloquial language, with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world.”

A month later black English players Ashley Cole and Shaun-Wright Phillips were subjected to racist abuse from the crowd at the Bernabeu during an England-Spain ‘friendly’. The Spanish Football Federation was initially fined £44,650 .But it took the Spanish Football Federation another  five months to take any further action of its own and when it came it horrified anti-racism campaigners by its levity.Aragones was fined 3,000 Euros, equivalent to his estimated day’s wages. The Director General of Spain’s Sports Council Rafael Blanco dismissed any link between the reaction of isolated groups of fans and Aragones’ comments.

 Both incidents put Spanish football’s attitudes towards race under international scrutiny, exposing a culture at best of ambivalence, at worst of collective denial within Spain itself. Henry himself described the ineffectiveness of the fines as “absolutely ridiculous’ “You really have to look at the Spanish authorities and they must take a long look at themselves. They obviously don’t care about racism. It is laughable. They fined Aragones for the sake of it, not because they felt he did something wrong, “he declared.

By contrast Henry’s other Spanish Arsenal colleague Manuel Almunia along with  players from La Liga ,  black and white,  including  the Brazilian-born   Spanish international midfielder Marcos Senna followed the line adopted by Spanish officials, insisting that  Aragones was really a decent guy but a victim of overreaction  and misunderstanding. He had been lost in translation, in other words.

Aragones was not sacked, after the Spanish media further excused his statement and the monkey chants of the Spanish fans. While a minority of Spanish commentators were critical of Aragones, the episode, as the seasoned Irish hispanist Paddy Woodworth pointed out , revealed  “deeply contradictory attitudes to race in the Spanish psyche, which go back a long, long way”. However perhaps the most surprising thing about the British media’s response to the racism displayed by elements of the Spanish football world was  that they should have been so surprised.

 As any British journalist, player, or coach who has been closely involved in Spanish football over many years has witnessed, Spain has been no more immune from racism than any other country. Long after the Franco dictatorship had given way to parliamentary democracy in Spain, it was not uncommon to hear monkey chants and other racial abuse greet black players in Spanish stadiums. In 2006, the FC Barcelona player Eto’o walked off the pitch after suffering continual racist abuse from Zaragoza fans. Three years later Barcelona fans were shown on national TV repeatedly abusing Espanyol’s Cameroon international goalkeeper Carlos Kameni with the club’s stewards doing nothing to deal with the situation.

Modern Spain struggled to come to terms with itself as a multi-cultural society when faced with the huge rise in immigration.  Nevertheless a growing number of Spanish born sons of immigrants were making their way through the youth academies to the first teams of major clubs and competing for places in the national squad.  Perhaps one of the most interesting recent examples was the promotion in December 2009 of Jonas Ramalho-the son of an Angolan father and a Basque mother- to the first team of Athletic, the last remaining major Spanish club to incorporate a black player, because of its long-standing policy of having only totally Basque blood players.

Three years earlier, Spain, under Aragones, came to the World Cup in Germany with few friends among the British press certainly. The ‘racism’ issue was not so easily dismissed. FIFA used the tournament, in the words of Brian Glanville, “for a half baked, superficial initiative to ‘kick out racism. Its “irrelevance was sharply exposed” by the presence of the Ukrainian manager Oleg Blockhin who had escaped any sanction despite having made a “venomous, unashamedly racist attack on the use of black footballers in his country. But equally worthy of censure, according to Glanville was the immunity of Aragones. He was “guilty of a gross and gratuitous piece of racism”. Although the Spanish Federation had fined him, Glanville found the punishment inadequate. “If UEFA, not to say FIFA, were looking for someone to punish as an example, here surely was a clear candidate.”

And yet as even Glanville was forced to admit Aragones’ Spanish team had also come to the world stage “trailing clouds of glory, long unbeaten,” and with a different narrative with which to win hearts and minds. It was Aragones in an early encounter with the Spanish media that referred to his squad as La Roja. Ever since most Spaniards could remember-and that dated back to the Franco years- the squad had been called ‘La Seleccion Nacional’ (The national team). But the definition of nationhood became a complicated business in post-Franco Spain with various regions claiming increasing autonomy if not independence from Madrid .Only a minority of Spanish fans of an extreme right persuasion objected to a colour that for them conjured up memories of communists in the Civil War. There were others-again a minority- who took a cynical view that Aragones wanted to ingratiate himself with  the incumbent socialist government of Jose Luis Zapatero, which  was still living a pre-crisis honeymoon period.

For his part, Aragones played down any deeper political significance behind La Roja . The  fact was that the Spanish team had played in red shirt (and blue trousers) even during the latter years of the Franco regime. Spain was now simply following in the steps of other successful football nations who had made a trademark of their shirt colours – Italy (Azure); France (Les Bleus), the Dutch (Brilliant Orange.) For those with marketing ambitions, or of a more philosophical bent, La Roja transformed the somewhat  destructive and negative La Furia of old into something as vital but more life giving as wine or even blood, transfused rather than spilt.  From such synchronicity, the best Spanish tourist posters had been made. Spain was not only different, it was now potentially better by far.

Spain got off to an impressive start, beating Ukraine 4-0, and ending up unbeaten at the top of their group after defeating Saudi Arabia and Tunis. With Marcos Senna, a bedrock in midfield, supported by two of the most versatile and hard-working defenders, in La Liga- Barca’s Carlos Pujol and Real Madrid Sergio Ramos, the squad strike capability was beefed up with the inclusion of three young’turks’ Valencia’s David Villa (a future Barca player) and David Silva and Atletico de Madrid’s Fernando Torres, who would subsequently transfer to the English |Premier League. Within a year of the World Cup Torres would join another Spanish international  Xabi Alonso,  and Spanish coach Rafa Benitez at Liverpool, and later Chelsea. Silva would later move to Manchester City.

But predictions in the Spanish media that La Roja, which had had an unbeaten run of twenty-five matches, would go on and beat France in the next round – Marca headlined ‘WE ARE GOING TO SEND ZIDANE INTO RETIREMENT!” -proved overoptimistic. Spain lost and exited the tournament That autumn, following a defeat by Northern Ireland and by  Sweden-seemingly making qualification for Euro 2008 difficult-  Aragones struggled to hang on to his job. The fickle Spanish media turned and called for his resignation, forcing the Spanish Federation’s president Angela Maria Villar belatedly to come to his defence in public.

 Behind the scenes the Federation had contacted Miguel Angel Lotina about taking over, but the plan was shelved after Spain beat Argentina 2-1 in a friendly and the players had united behind Aragones. “When one loses, everything is a disaster, there is a lot of criticism, and most of it at the ‘Mister’ (the coach). That is unfair and that is how we all saw it. We became stronger and more united around him, “recalled Pujol. 

It was not just the Spanish media that was unimpressed. The doyenne of British commentators on Spanish football, Sid Lowe of the Guardian was strongly critical of Aragones: “He is the coach that couldn’t even take Spain to their traditional quarter-final exit point at the World Cup. He is the coach whose timing is so bad that he stuck by Raul when he was awful and unfit  then, motivated more by the captain’s response to being a substitute during the World Cup than his performances, dropped him just as he was showing signs of getting back to form.”

The Spanish coach had in fact offered up his resignation twice.Aragones  was on record as saying he would walk away if Spain did not get to the semi-final of the World Cup, only to insist that he wouldn’t allow himself to be prisoner of his words. Lowe described Aragones’ 25 years in management as actually “pretty average”, claimed that his “constant chopping and changing” had undermined  the squad, and that he was not the kind of person that be allowed to manage a national squad anyway. “His behavior is just plain bizarre-from cutting television cables that ran “suspiciously” close to the dugout, to escaping false teeth and disappearing down secret tunnels to avoid shaking hands with his enemies, “wrote Lowe.

In the coming months it became clear that far from contributing to another Spanish football disaster, Aragones had laid the foundations of a predominately youth-based and dynamic project that deserved time to mature. Aragones moved from being lampooned as an eccentric geriatric to living up to his legendary reputation for wisdom. At Euro 2008, he took Spain to its first major international trophy (outside the gold of the Olympics) in 44 years, a Torres goal securing a precious 1-0 victory over Germany in Vienna.

Spain was finally champions. And they had done it in a way that  seemed brush aside old political antagonisms while encompassing all the best currents of style that had hitherto developed in a dysfunctional manner, and mainly at club level. Spain played with the high-tempo virility that had been the badge of the English since they first arrived in Rio Tinto, but with the technique and inspired creativity that had shown itself over many years, criss-crossing across the Atlantic. As the football journalist Paul Doyle commented: “With players like Iniesta, Xavi, Cesc Fabregas, Ramos, Torres, Villa, David Silva, and Iker Casillas Spain had a vibrant organization, each element exuding adventure and intelligence. Their movement, speed and offensive intent make them devastating.”

So what had brought about this transformative fusion? The answer lay partly in Aragones’ pragmatism, and partly in the nature of the players themselves. Perhaps Aragones’ most totemic moment was when he decided to exclude Raul, one of the legendary star players of Real Madrid, judging him past his peak, and a destabilizing element both in the changing room and in the field, having got used to exercising too much power in his club.

A watershed was reached when that autumn, in the run up to Euro 2008, Aragones dropped Raul Gonzalez from the squad and brought in Raul Tamudo Montero, captain of Espanyol.With Torres and Villa injured, Aragones gambled on another newcomer Raul Albiol in defence along with   Iniesta, Xavi and Cesc Fabregas as then backbone of his team.  Spain played sensationally in a key qualifying match against Denmark, beating them 3-1 with the victory rounded off thanks to a superb debut international goal by Albert Riera after Aragones had substituted Joaquin in the 69th minute. The match proved a huge moral boost for the Spanish squad as it ensured their qualification for a tournament they believed they could win.

 Thus was Aragones proved right. Spain played better without Raul (Gonzalez). Drawing on the legacy, among others of Cruyff, Aragones had finally embraced tiki-taka, the style that prioritized passing, patience and possession above all else, and for this he drew on players for whom such beauty in motion came naturally. For years, Spanish commentators had tried to excuse their country’s failure with talk of bad luck, without ever quite admitting that the country just did not have a collective unit of native players capable of delivering the successes they achieved at club level. But now the talk was, of an exciting unprecedented talent pool that transferred seamlessly from club to national squad, and coalesced to play football that was both aesthetic and effective.

A mixture of bad luck and bad play had combined to deny the Spanish national squad (with the exception of the Olympic Gold in 1992) any major tournament victory since Marcelino’s winning goal against Russia in the European Nations Cup final at the Bernabeu on the 21st June 1964.  Now the Gods smiled on a team that felt it deserved to win, and could. Minutes before the start of the game the Spanish coach Luis Aragones took Torres to one side in the dressing room and repeated a ritual he had once performed when the coach and the rising young star were both at Atletico de Madrid. “You are going to score two goals,” Aragones told Torres and then drew the sign of the Cross on his forehead.

The Torres goal in the 33rd minute of the Euro 2008 final at the Ernst Happel stadium in Vienna, was a defining moment in a tournament in which La Roja, had finally proved themselves worthy champions of Europe with their formidable attacking football. In an important sense this was an emblemic parting of the ways for Spanish football. Torres saw his star rise just as another legend of Spanish football, Raul saw his fall-and for that too Aragones was responsible, earning the wrath of diehard Real Madri

 Save for later
A gifted, inventive footballer and a controversial manager, both at club and international levels, Luis Aragonés, who has died aged 75 of leukaemia, was also a plain speaker with a sometimes explosive temper. However, he helped raise Spanish spirits to new heights in the summer of 2008 when he led the national team to their first title in 44 years as they lifted the European championship trophy.

Aragonés was already aged 70 when the Spaniards beat Germany 1-0 to win the cup in Vienna – making him the oldest coach to win the contest – having taken over four years earlier after the constantly underachieving side had again failed to distinguish themselves in the 2004 European Championship finals in Portugal. Further disappointment followed two years later in the World Cup finals in Germany, but Aragonés left the team well placed to consolidate their position as a major force in the international game under his successor Vicente del Bosque, winning both the 2010 World Cup and 2012 European Cup.

Born in Hortaleza, on the northern fringes of Madrid – and later nicknamed the Wise Man of Hortaleza – Aragonés was 14 when his father died, and the family made a living from having the only van in the area. Luis began playing for a Jesuit college team, and then Getafe, to the south of the capital, signing for Real Madrid in 1958. But he never got a game for them, and was lent to Real Oviedo, where in December 1960 he made his first-division debut. At the end of that season he went to the Seville club Real Betis, where he truly established himself, scoring 33 goals in 86 games.

Although no prodigy, Aragonés was an inside-right of high skill, intelligence and quality. In 1964, he joined Atlético Madrid, where he stayed for a decade in which the club won three championships and two cups, growing famous for his insidious free kicks and precise penalty kicks. In the 1969-70 season he was one of three top scorers in the Spanish league, with 16 goals. Between 1965 and 1972, he was capped 11 times by Spain.

Aragonés did much to get Atlético as far as the European Cup final in Brussels in 1974, not least in Belgrade against Red Star, conquerors in the second round of Liverpool: he scored Atlético's first goal in a 2-0 win. The final – or to be precise, both finals, for there was a replay – was a strange affair. There were just six minutes left of extra time during the first encounter when Aragonés cleverly curled a free kick into Bayern Munich's goal. That seemed to be that, but almost with the last kick of the game the big Bayern central defender, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, thundered upfield to score from 30 yards. In the replay, Atlético collapsed and lost 4-0.

After the first six games of the 1974-75 season, Atlético offered Aragonés their managership, and he promptly retired as a player. He had scored 160 goals in 360 league games.

After six years managing Atlético, he briefly took over at Real Betis in 1981-82, before returning to Atlético for another five years. In 1987 he moved to Barcelona, succeeding the sacked Terry Venables, but lasted barely a single season, despite reviving the team.

In 1990 he moved across Barcelona to take charge of Espanyol. Thereafter his career was unsettled: two seasons back with Atlético (1991-93), two at Seville, two at Valencia, two at Betis, one at Oviedo (1999-2000), two one-year spells at Real Mallorca, sandwiching a couple of seasons back with Atlético (2001-03), during the first of which he brought them back from the second division. As a manager he won just one championship, with Valencia in 1977, but won the cup four times, in 1976, 1985, 1988 and 1992.

His first task as national manager was to take Spain to the 2006 World Cup finals, which he accomplished with some difficulty, needing victory in a play-off against Slovakia in November 2005. A 5-1 first leg win in Madrid was followed by a 1-1 draw in Bratislava.

However, when it came to the finals in Germany, Thierry Henry had the chance of getting his own back for a racist jibe Aragonés had made to another player, apparently in the cause of motivation. This had happened two years earlier, and the manager was heavily criticised. After cruising through the first round, Spain confronted France in the second round in Hanover. With the score at 1-1, Henry collapsed dramatically under a challenge from Carles Puyol. The resulting free-kick from Zinédine Zidane reached Patrick Vieira, who scored, with Zidane making it 3-1 in injury time.

When the 2008 European finals arrived, Aragonés, whose team had qualified without panache and were seeded 12th, dropped the captain Raúl (Raúl González Blanco, also the captain of Real Madrid), preferring two younger strikers, Fernando Torres, then Liverpool's newest star striker, and David Villa, both of whom were destined to shine. With first-round victories over Russia (4-1), Sweden (2-1) and Greece (2-1), Spain went on to eliminate the reigning world champions Italy deservedly on penalties (4-2) in the quarter-final — the first time that they had beaten Italy in a competitive match since 1920, also breaking Spain's long record of defeats in penalty shoot-outs. They then beat Russia again (3-0) in the semi-final (Russia had progressed as runners-up in the initial group stage) and Germany in the final, thanks to a superb 33rd-minute individual goal by the dynamic Torres. After lifting the trophy, they were further rewarded a few days later by being seeded No 1 in the Fifa world rankings, the first team never to have won a World Cup to achieve this.

Puyol remarked: "Aragonés taught us to believe it was possible. He was the first to be convinced that we, as a team playing with a clear style, could win." Aragonés himself said: "The criticism has taught me a lot, except when I am insulted. It has stimulated me and encouraged me to do things better." At the end of his 54 matches as national coach, his record stood at won 38, drawn 12, and lost only four – a Spanish record.

For most men of that age, having reached such a pinnacle, summer 2008 would have seemed a good moment to retire. But not the irrepressible Aragonés: he had a cussed, even eccentric, streak. He was once caught on camera cutting a television cable that he considered to be suspiciously close to the dugout; he accused a fan of being "uglier than two horses"; and he once told a player to get on with the game because there was "nothing bloody wrong with you" – the player had a broken jaw.

So for the first time in his career he left Spain, to take over as manager of the Turkish club Fenerbahçe. However, the following summer they finished fourth in the league, and he was dismissed.

Aragonés is survived by his wife, Pepa, five children and 11 grandchildren.

=== Celtic v Atletico Madrid 'scum match' ref Dogan Babacan: UEFA congratulated me on my display ===
The Record 
Sep 14 2011 By Gavin Berry
Dogan Babacan

THE man in charge of the infamous battle at Parkhead between Celtic and Atletico Madrid 37 years ago was hailed by UEFA in a letter congratulating him on his performance.

Dogan Babacan spoke out yesterday after the flames of controversy were re-ignited by Hoops legend Billy McNeil when he branded the Spaniards scum for thuggish antics during their 1974 European Cup semi-final first-leg clash in Glasgow.
And the hugely respected former Turkish whistler defended his own display despite Atletico Madrid making a complaint against him for sending off three of their players - and dishing out another 10 yellows on a night of madness and mayhem.

But Babacan insists Europe's governing body were on his side and he has the letter to prove it . In it they praised the way he handled an incredible situation which he blames on Juan Carlos Lorenzo's side being wracked by nerves and shaking with fear.

In a week when many involved in that match have had their say on an ugly 90 minutes, it was the turn of arguably the most important man on the night to have his say from his home in Turkey where is now in charge of his country's referees as well as working in the media.

Babacan, who made history as the first referee to issue a red card in the World Cup finals at Germany 1974, said: "I can still remember the game in Glasgow.
"It was such an important game and ended in a scoreless draw. But I got all the attention because of my cards - 10 yellow and three red. All the reds were for Atletico Madrid.
"I don't know why but it was an aggressive game. I think the key was maybe that the Spanish players were very nervous. But I'm satisfied with my work that night. I tried to calm down the tension by showing some yellow cards early on but the players just couldn't stop playing hard.
"I sent off Ruben Ayala for his second yellow. The next player I sent off was Panadero Diaz but the third was very interesting.
"His name was Quique and he came on after 76 minutes - and 15 seconds later saw my third red card. This time it was a straight red. There can be no question marks over my performance.
"The French newspaper, France Soir, wrote that I was the best referee in Europe that night and the English media reported that Turkey should be proud to have a referee like me. But of course the Spanish were a bit mad at me.
"About two weeks after the game I received a letter from UEFA with a plane ticket to Geneva.
"I had to visit the disciplinary committee because Atletico had appealed the third sending-off. They wanted to know why I showed a straight red.
"I explained he'd been on the bench for 76 minutes and could monitor the game and how it was going, especially my performance. He could see what kind of referee I was for 76 minutes.
"He could focus on the fact I'd given out so many cards but I don't think he watched the game as he came on the field and it was 'bingo' from his first move. The committee were happy with that.
"I later received a letter from UEFA president Artemio Franchi saying that I was one of the best referees in Europe and UEFA thanked me for a great game. My reward was to be in charge of the UEFA Super Cup that year between Dynamo Kiev and Bayern Munich."

Atletico Madrid players have been enraged by McNeill's comments ahead of the meeting between the clubs this week in the Vicente Calderon and ex-striker Jose Garate insisted Babacan was selective with his actions in Glasgow.

He said: "There were kicks and elbows all over the place but the referee chose only to see our actions and not those of the Celtic players.
"Our coach warned us it would be hard but really it was war. Many of our players were lucky to avoid serious injury. It was really dangerous but we imposed our quality on them. I want to see a match on Thursday without controversy.
"McNeill has said too much - maybe he still hasn't digested the defeat."

If you were not aware of Real Madrid and FC Barcelona’s dominance of Spanish football, you could be excused for thinking that Club Atlético de Madrid’s record of nine league titles & nine wins in the Copa del Rey would place them at the top of the tree. 

Alas, it would seem that they are forever destined to live in the shadow of their powerful neighbours and the kings of Catalunya. However, the story of the underdog is often more interesting and there are plenty of twists and turns in the story of Atlético.

Founded in 1903 as Athletic Club de Madrid, the club led a very nomadic existence in their early years, starting out at Campo de Vallecas in the east of Madrid. After 10 years they moved in with Sociedad Madrid (later renamed Real Madrid) at the Campo O’Donnell.

In 1923 they moved again, this time to the north-west of Madrid to the newly built Estadio Metropolitano. However, over the next 13 years, the club alternated between the Metropolitano and Campo de Vallecas.

After the Civil War, and under the new name of Atlético de Aviación, the club moved in with Real Madrid at the Estadio Chamartin as the Campo de Vallecas was still awaiting conversion back from a POW camp and the war had reduced the Metropolitano to a pile of rubble.

1940 saw the Campo de Vallecas back in working order so the club returned to the east of the city until in 1943. That was when the rebuilt Metropolitano was reopened and here they stayed until 1966. By the late 1950’s, Metropolitano had become a mix and match of stands and terraces, hemmed in on all sides by housing and other development.

So in 1961, the renamed Atlético de Madrid purchased large plot of land in the south western outskirts of Madrid, next to a gas works and on the banks of the Rio Manzanares.

Work was slow, and with the club suffering financially, they moved in with Real Madrid during the 1964-65 season. They returned to the Metropolitano for one final season in 1965-66 and won the Primera title. Then, finally on 2 October 1966, the stadium was sort of ready and unofficially opened with a match against Valencia.  It was initially called the Estadio del Manzanares after the river that ran behind the main stand.

I say main stand, as back in 1966, this was an open bank of seats with a construction site behind it. Money was still tight and the upper tier of the main stand that sits tight to the bank of the Manzanares and over the six-lane M30 Madrid ring road, was not completed until 1970. At this point the stadium was renamed Estadio Vicente Calderón after the President of the club who had overseen its development.

Complete and with a roof to boot, the 62,000 all-seat stadium (the first in Spain) was officially opened in the presence of General Franco on 23 May 1972 with a friendly against Uruguay.

The stadium was chosen to host three matches in the 1982 World Cup, but once again played second fiddle to Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu. Strangely, all the matches were second round ties played over a six day period, featuring France, Austria and Northern Ireland.


 
The highest attendance of 37,000 did not exactly test the stadium. La Seleccion has played at the stadium on six occasions, the last visit coming in 2009 with a 2-1 win over against Argentina.

Viewed from the air, Estadio Vicente Calderón is an extraordinary sight. In part, it’s typical of Spanish grounds of this period with two large tiers of uncovered seats that curve around the pitch.

These three sides could easily pass as Sevilla’s Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, but then rather abruptly, the tiers stop, sliced like a birthday cake. There are no corner stands to the west of the ground, just that huge stand sitting over the motorway. Whilst architecturally it has always been a striking stadium, it was until the late 1980’s very stark.



The mood was lightened with the addition of bands of red and white seats on the upper tier and blue seats on the lower tier, reflecting the clubs colours and nickname, el colchonero or mattress makers.

The top of the upper tier saw the addition of executive boxes in 2002, and those awkward gaps either side of the main stand are now filled with two huge TV screens.

The alterations to the media area and changes to individual seats from benches have reduced the capacity to 54,851, more than enough for Atlético’s average of 40,000. The stadium’s days appear to be numbered however, as work was due to start early in 2011 on converting the Estadio de la Comunidad or La Peineta to a 73,000 seat stadium.

The move is not popular with Atlético’s fan base given that its location is way across to the north east of Madrid, well away from their heartland. The club is due to move in 2013, but given the current financial crisis, fan opposition and the length of time it took to finish the Vicente Calderón, I wouldn’t start packing just yet.

=== Madrid – Estadio La Peineta / Nuevo Estadio del Club Atlético de Madrid ===
by Chris Clements | Posted on Tuesday, April 21st, 2015

Atletico Madrid / Headlines / LFP / Madrid / New Build

History has a funny habit of repeating itself. Just over 50 years ago, the then President of Atlético Madrid Don Vicente Calderón, purchased a large plot of land in the south western outskirts of Madrid. Here, up tight to the bank of the Rio Manzanarés, would be where his beloved club would build their new home. Work on the proposed stadium was tortuously slow, and with the club suffering financially, many questioned the logic of the development. However, Calderón was not for turning. Atléti sold their Old Metropolitano home and finally moved into the unfinished stadium in October 1966. It took another 4 years to complete the project, but 12 years after first breaking the ground the club had a stadium to rival any in the country. Move on to 2013 and Atléti was involved in another protracted and controversial stadium development.
AtleticoMadrid290315a
Just a little bit of history repeating itself?

The focus of their desired move was the Estadio La Peineta, a disused municipal athletics stadium in the north east of Madrid, just south of Barajas Airport. Opened in 1994, it originally cost 7,500 million pesetas (€45m), which was an awful lot of money for not a lot of stadium. The formal name for the stadium was Estadio de la Comunidad de Madrid, but it became known as La Peineta because its only stand was shaped like an ornamental comb. With a capacity of 20,000, it has always been a bit of a white elephant, hosting the occasional athletics meeting, but never in front of a full house. Even when the Supercopa de España was held there in 1996, Atléti & Barcelona attracted just 15,000 spectators. Little over 10 years after opening, the stadium had fallen into disrepair, but it remained in the public eye thanks to Madrid’s attempts to win the 2012, 2016 & 2020 Olympiads. La Peineta was ideally located, close to the airport and with an expanse of land ripe for developing an Olympic Park. Atléti had come on board in 2007, and the club’s on-going occupation of the stadium was part of the legacy programme for the 2016 & 2020 bids. Unfortunately for Madrid, the IOC preferred London, Rio & Tokyo. However, despite Madrid’s Olympic hopes lying dead in the water, Atléti pressed on with plans to occupy the site.

AtleticoMadrid291213c
Comb Over – La Peineta’s days were numbered from the beginning

So how can a club with reported debts of €500m afford to build a new stadium? Well, the answer lies close to home. Atlético Madrid owns the Estadio Vicente Calderón, and FCC, a leading Spanish construction company, covets the land that it and the adjoining Mahou Beer Factory stand on. In return for this piece of prime real estate, FCC will build Atléti a modern stadium on the site of La Peineta at little or potentially no cost. The proposed cost of the build will be €270m. All Atléti would have to pay is approximately €40m to the City of Madrid who own the land on which La Peineta stands. This will be paid in a series of debentures made up of free tickets granted to the city over a ten year period. However, if Madrid was to successfully bid for the 2024 Olympiad, the stadium would be used to host the games. This would result in the club having to relocate for a period of 12 months whilst the lower tier of the stadium is covered with a temporary platform holding the athletics track. As a result of this inconvenience, Atléti would be paid compensation of, you guessed it, €40m.

AtleticoMadrid291213b
No money? No problem

Quite a neat deal you would think? Well, this being Atléti, nothing is quite as straightforward as it seems. First of all, the fans were up in arms over a move that would see the club relocate 12km to the north east of Madrid. They launched a legal challenge, arguing that it was illegal to build higher than four storeys in the city centre of Madrid, which meant that FCC may not receive anything close to the revenues it was expecting. The case went to appeal, but was found in the favour of the club. In the spring of 2011, the club announced they had received planning permission for the redevelopment of La Peineta and work would soon commence. Soon in Atléti parlance meant November, when the club organised a big media gathering to watch, in essence, the breaking up of a few pieces of old terracing. Predictably, the speed of the build at La Peineta has all ranged from slow to an out-right halt. Work in the spring of 2012 saw the lower tier of the main stand removed, the floodlights pole-axed and removal of the athletics track. By the end of 2012, the site had been excavated and foundation piles fixed. Slow progress, but as history has shown, that was nothing new for Atléti.

AtleticoMadrid311213a
April 2012 and the comb shows its teeth

Further delays followed in 2013, when the authorities refused to grant the necessary licences for construction cranes to placed on site. Then in September 2013 the project received what many believed to be a mortal blow. Madrid lost out on hosting the Olympic Games for a third consecutive time. However, what many people had overlooked was that the project had evolved from an Olympic stadium that could be used to host football, to a football stadium that could be converted to host the Olympics. A crucial element in saving the project’s future. Atléti pressed on, and with the cranes on site and the lower tier starting to develop, the shape of the stadium was now beginning to emerge. Of course, the delays and the club’s financial predicament have only added to the speculation that the stadium will follow the path of Valencia’s Nou Mestalla. There is however a new belief, no doubt assisted by Atléti’s renaissance on the pitch, that the stadium will be built and the club’s days at the Vicente Calderón are numbered.

AtleticoMadrid281213c
Slowly, but surely Atléti is getting there

So, with that positive thought still fresh in our minds, what will the stadium look like? The new build has been designed by Cruz & Ortiz, who were responsible for designing the original Estadio La Peineta back in the early 1990’s. The upper tier and basic infrastructure of the original West Tribuna has been kept, reducing cost and nicely breaking any boring symmetry that can be the bane of modern stadia. The remaining three sides will feature four distinct levels. The lower tier will consist of 28 rows and hold approximately 23,000. The next tier will feature 14,000 seats, including VIP seating and access to the Directors lounge. The upper tier will consist of 32 rows on the three new sides as well as incorporating the existing upper tier from the original stadium. This tier will hold just over 30,000. In addition, a mezzanine level will be constructed between levels two & three. This will be a continuous ring around the stadium and house 94 private boxes, providing seating for nearly 1,500 spectators, along with 150 press booths. The final capacity will be around 68,000, all of which will be housed under a twin-ring cantilevered roof, very similar to that at the Estadio Olímpico de Sevilla. The rest of the structure will feature the ubiquitous bars, club museum &  shops as well as office space, all increasing non-match day revenue. The pitch dimensions will be identical to that of the Calderón and all UEFA/FIFA Elite stadium requirements will be met.

No longer a pipe-dream – Atléti plan to be in-situ in 2017

To be honest, I genuinely doubted that Atléti would get even this far, and whilst there is a long way to go before Los Colchoneros run out on to the turf at the new stadium, there is a belief and growing momentum behind the build. And given the parallels between this project and the development of the Vicente Calderón, you can’t help but wonder if the move to the new stadium will herald a new golden era in the club’s history. Just as it did when they moved to the south west of Madrid in the 1960’s.

=== España 82 – Madrid – Estadio Vicente Calderón ===
1982 World Cup / Mundial 1982
0

by Chris Clements | Posted on Monday, July 2nd, 2012
Madrid and its two cavernous stadiums were late-comers to the España 82 party. The tournament had criss-crossed the length and breadth of the country, but finally after 15 days of waiting, the Spanish capital got to stage a match. The Estadio Vicente Calderón was an obvious choice as a venue, given that it was little over a decade old and had an all-seated capacity of 66,000. However, whether it was the host nation’s poor performances in the first round or the presence of two relative minnows, the matches at the Calderón were poorly attended, with practically half the seats left empty for the matches featuring France, Austria & Northern Ireland.

ESTADIO VICENTE CALDERÓN
The home of Atlético Madrid had been built over a seven year period from 1963, and was finally completed in 1970, although Atléti had moved into a three sided stadium in 1966. The main stand, which straddles a six-lane ring-road, almost stands separate from the remainder of the stadium, which is made up of a two-tiers in a horseshoe configuration. Little in the way of refurbishment was required for the tournament, although new media facilities were added to the west tribuna and large video screens were installed in the gaps between the main stand and the open tiers. With every match a second round affair played over a six day period, one would have expected better crowds, but with a highest attendance of 37,000, the Calderón’s capacity was not exactly tested. You can read more about the stadium and Atlético Madrid here.

Can you spot the difference? Probably not
FRANCE vs AUSTRIA – GAME 1 GROUP D
France were dominant against a poor Austrian side, who were clearly exhausted by their exploits against West Germany in Gijón! Genghini’s excellent free-kick was the only score of the game, but France missed a number of chances in the second half, that would have ensured a more convincing scoreline.
 
AUSTRIA vs NORTHERN IRELAND – GAME 2 GROUP D
Only 20,000 spectators watched an entertaining match which did not help either side in their hopes of progressing. Northern Ireland were the happier, with Hamilton’s late equaliser keeping their hopes of a semi-final appearance just about alive. Austria, who started the tournament brightly , but ended it in a whimper, headed home.

 
FRANCE vs NORTHERN IRELAND – GAME 2 GROUP D
France eased their way into the semi-finals with a comfortable win over Northern Ireland. Giresse and Rocheteau did the damage in a comfortable win with two goals a-piece. Northern Ireland’s reply from Gerry Armstrong was too-little too-late, but they left the tournament with their reputation massively enhanced. As for France, they headed to Sevilla and one of the matches of the tournament. 

=== Madrid – Estadio Vicente Calderón ===
by Chris Clements | Posted on Thursday, May 26th, 2011
If you didn’t know of Real Madrid and FC Barcelona’s dominance of Spanish football, you could be excused for thinking that Club Atlético de Madrid’s record of 10 league titles & 10 wins in the Copa del Rey put them at the top of the tree.  Alas, it would seem that they are forever destined to live in the shadow of their powerful neighbours and the kings of Catalunya. However, the story of the underdog is often more interesting and there are plenty of twists and turns in the story of Atlético.

50 years old, but time is up – The Estadio Vicente Calderón in 2016

Now I’m sure you are aware that the Estadio Vicente Calderón is not Atlético’s first stadium. I cover the early history of the club here, but in order to get you up to speed here is a potted history. Founded in 1903 as Athletic Club de Madrid, they played for the first 10 years at the Campo del Retiro in the east of Madrid. They then moved to a more central location on the Calle O’Donnell, just a short kick from Sociedad Madrid’s (later renamed Real Madrid) new enclosure on the same street. Then in 1923 they moved to the north-west of Madrid to the newly built Estadio Metropolitano. However, over the next 13 years, the club alternated between the Metropolitano and Campo de Vallecas which was in the east of the Madrid. After the Civil War, and under the new name of Atlético de Aviación, the club moved in with Real Madrid at the Campo de Chamartin as the Campo de Vallecas was still awaiting conversion back from a POW camp and the war had reduced the Metropolitano to a pile of rubble. Then in 1940, with Campo de Vallecas back in working order the club returned to the east of the city. That was until in 1943, when Atléti returned to the rebuilt Metropolitano.

By the late 1950’s, Metropolitano had become a mix and match of stands and terraces, hemmed in on all sides by housing and other development. So in 1961, Atlético de Madrid (they changed from Aviación in 1947) purchased large plot of land in the south western outskirts of Madrid, next to a gas works and on the banks of the Rio Manzanarés. Work was slow, and with the club suffering financially, they moved in with Real Madrid during the 1964-65 season. They returned to the Metropolitano for one final season in 1965-66 and won the Primera title.

1968 and the Vincente Calderon awaits the completion of main stand

Then, finally on 2 October 1966, the stadium was sort of ready and unofficially opened with a match against Valencia. It was initially called the Estadio del Manzanarés after the river that ran behind the main stand. I say main stand, as back in 1966, this was an open bank of seats with a construction site behind it. Money was still tight and the upper tier of the main stand, which sits tight to the bank of the Manzanarés and over the six-lane M30 Madrid ring road, was not completed until 1970. At this point the stadium was renamed Estadio Vicente Calderón after the President of the club who had overseen its development. Complete and with a roof to boot, the 62,000 all-seat stadium (the first in Spain) was officially opened in the presence of Franco and a young King Juan Carlos, on 23 May 1972 when Spain played a friendly against Uruguay.

Topped-off – Vicente Calderón in the 1970’s

The new stadium did not have to wait long for it to witness success as the league was won in 1969-70. This was Atléti’s greatest team, for in a eight year period they won three league titles, two Copa del Rey’s and if it wasn’t for a stunning last minute strike from Bayern Munich’s Schwarzenback, the would have won the 1974 European Cup. Two days later, Bayern won the replay 4-0. They did however win the Intercontinental Cup later that year, replacing Bayern who declined the invitation, beating Argentina’s Independente 4-1 over two legs. In January 1976, King Juan Carlos returned the the Estadio Vicente Calderón with his wife Queen Sofia, in their first public appearance at a sporting event as reigning monarchs. A coincidence or a shrewd tactic that distanced the monarchy from any pro-Real Madrid allegiances?

The stadium was chosen to host three matches in the 1982 World Cup, but once again played second fiddle to Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu. Strangely, all the matches were second round affairs played over a six day period, featuring France, Austria and Northern Ireland. The highest attendance of 37,000 did not exactly test the stadium. The stadium does get more respectable attendances when the Spanish National side venture to the south west of Madrid. La Selección has played at the stadium on ten occasions, the first being that 1973 friendly against Uruguay and the last coming in October 2012, when Spain played France in a crucial qualifier for the 2014 World Cup.

Since the late 1970’s however, pickings have been on the slim side. Whilst the club has fared fairly well in the Copa del Rey with five further victories, it has only added two league titles to its tally in the past 40 years. Much of this period was under the stewardship of President Jesús Gil and the less said about him the better. After securing that fourth Copa del Rey in 1996 and therefore completing the double, the club fell into decline and then in June 2000, the unthinkable happened. After 63 seasons in La Primera, Atlético was relegated to La Segunda. Gil shrugged it off and said that the club would endure year in hell before bouncing back, but after a dreadful start to the season, they were playing catch up and eventually lost out on the final promotion place to CD Tenerife due to an inferior head to head record. Atléti returned to La Primera in 2002, but it took the arrival of a former player as manager to kick-start a new era. Since Diego Simeone took over at the helm in 2011, Atléti has won the Europa League, UEFA Super Copa, Copa de Rey and after an 18-year hiatus, a coveted tenth league title.

Vicente Calderón – Atlético’s stadium of two halves

It seems strange that Atléti chose this location knowing that it would require quite some feat of engineering to overcome the twin obstacles of a motorway and river right up close to the western side. Viewed from the air however, you can see that the club has solved the problem with style and panache. In part, the Estadio Vicente Calderón is typical of Spanish grounds of this period with two large tiers of uncovered seats that curve around the pitch. These three sides could easily pass as Sevilla’s Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, but then, rather abruptly, the tiers stop, sliced like a birthday cake. There are no corner stands to the west of the ground, just that huge stand hanging over the motorway. It would not have been beyond the architects to have continued the tiers around the western side, so that they linked seamlessly with the main stand. Had that happened however, the stadium would have lost its unique appeal, and it is all the better for its truncated form.

Vicente Calderón – Would you build a stadium here?

Whilst architecturally it has always been a striking stadium, it was until the late 1980’s very stark. The mood was lightened with the addition of bands of red and white seats on the upper tier and blue seats on the lower tier, reflecting the clubs colours and nickname, el colchóneros or mattress makers. The top of the upper tier saw the addition of executive boxes in 2002, and those awkward gaps either side of the main stand are now filled with two huge TV screens. The main stand also received a make over with the rear encased in blue glass, although this is only visible at ground level from the tenements that line the Rio Manzanarés. The stadium has no floodlight pylons, aping the style of so many large super bowls with a ring of lights on gantries around the lip of the bowl. The alterations to the media area and changes to individual seats from benches have reduced the capacity to 54,851, more than enough for Atlético’s average of 47,000.

Catch it while you can – Vincente Calderón in 2015

The stadium’s days are numbered however, as work started in 2011 on converting the Estadio de la Comunidad or La Peineta to a 67,500 seat stadium. The move is not popular with Atlético’s fan base given that its location is way across to the north east of Madrid, well away from their heartland. The club is due to move in 2017, but given the current financial crisis, fan opposition and the length of time it took to finish the Vicente Calderón, I wouldn’t bet on the completion date of July 2017 being met
=== The Story Of The Mattress-Makers ===
Written by Indranath Mukherjee on August 22, 2014
The league with the most free flowing football and an eye for goal is about to start. The duopoly was broken last year when a certain club from Madrid won La Liga and almost became the champions of Europe. Indranath Mukherjee goes back in time to focus on their illustrious history. Read on to know more with Goalden Times.
During the 2012–13 La Liga season, I had argued that Spanish football is more than the sum of the two giants—Barcelona and Real Madrid (here’s the quick link for people who missed it the first time around: Spanish Corner | Looking Beyond FC Barcelona And Real Madrid). Sure enough, we got a new league champion in Spain in 2013-14, with Club Atlético de Madrid winning the top honours.,With their passionate brand of football that almost gave them their first UEFA Champions League title until Sergio Ramos equalised in the third minute of the injury time in the final at Lisbon’s Estádio da Luz, Diego Simeone’s team was a revelation last season. A week before from somewhat similar situation at the Camp Nou, Diego Godín’s goal ensured La Liga for Atlético for the first time since 1996. Simeone, an ex-Atlético player (1994-1997 and 2003-2005) himself, took charge of the club in December 2011 when Gregorio Manzano was sacked after a poor show in La Liga. Atlético finished at number five in the league that season, but went on to win their second Europa League in three years. They started the following season by winning the 2012 UEFA Super Cup, thrashing previous season’s Champions League winner Chelsea 4-1. This was thanks to a first-half hat-trick by Radamel Falcao. They ultimately finished the season winning the Copa del Rey with an intense 2-1 win against city rival Real Madrid, ending a 14-year and 25-match winless streak in El Derbi Madrileño.
Much like Simeone, Atlético Madrid’s first series of triumphs came under another Argentine manager—Helenio Herrera. Under his able leadership, the team won consecutive league titles in 1950 and 1951. The club, in fact, had won its first consecutive titles when the league was resumed right after the Spanish Civil War in 1940, but its name was not Atlético Madrid then. The history of Atlético is actually one of the most complex and interesting in the annals of club football.
It all started when Ignacio Gortázar, Adolfo Artocha and Abdon of Alaiza—three Basques who were studying in Madrid— decided to start up some sort of a social club for the homesick Athletic Bilbao fans residing in the Spanish capital. As a result, a group of people met at café La Maison Doree in Alcala street on 26 April 1903, and another “Athletic” was established by the name of Athletic Club de Madrid. Their players wore the same blue and white shirt as Bilbao.
Atletico Madrid: 1925 2nd regional championship.
Atletico Madrid: 1925 2nd regional championship.
In the following year, some dissident members of Real Madrid joined the gang to provide further momentum to the club. On 22 January 1911, they played their first match in their now famous red and white striped shirts. These shirts were apparently made from cheap unused mattresses and soon earned the team the nickname of Los Colchoneros – Mattress-makers.
In 1913, Athletic de Madrid played and lost the final of Campeonato Regional de Madrid, the regional championship against Real Madrid—then known as Madrid Foot-Ball. If they had won, they would have qualified for the Copa del Rey, but the Spanish rules disallowed two connected clubs from participating in the same competition, and Athletic de Bilbao had already qualified. Next year, they cut all their ties with their Basque counterparts and became a fully independent football club.
Atlético’s first regional championship came in 1921 when they beat Real Unión de Irún in the final of Campeonato Regional de Madrid but lost 4-1 to Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final. Four years later, in 1925, they won the regional championship again and remained unbeaten in the tournament. However, they once again lost the Copa del Rey final to FC Barcelona.
Meanwhile, in 1923, Athletic moved to its own stadium—the Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid—a stadium with the capacity to hold 35,800 spectators. This would continue to be their home ground till 1966.

The Spanish Civil War had a mixed impact on the club. When the league resumed in 1939 after the war, they were not playing in the top division. However, interestingly enough, they were still chosen to replace Real Oviedo since the latter’s ground was totally destroyed in the war.  But 8 footballers of Athletic’s starting 11 had perished in the bloody war. So, the club’s board requested Colonel Francisco Salamanca to merge his crack airforce team Aviación Nacional de Zaragoza with them and renamed them Athletic Aviación de Madrid. This was changed a few months later, by Franco’s order, to Atlético Aviación. For a team that was to play in the lower division, Aviación won the league in 1939-40. As if they had a point to prove, they did it again in 1940-41. This startling success came under Barcelona’s legendary goalkeeper Ricardo Zamora. whose managerial stint got off to a flyer much like his footballing career did.
In 1947, the club removed the military association from its name and became Club Atlético de Madrid. In the same year, they beat Real Madrid 5-0 at home in La Liga. This still remains their biggest win against their city rivals. That year, Atlético finished third behind Barcelona and Valencia, while Real came close to relegation and finished at number 11 in the 14-club league. Atlético’s consecutive wins in 1950 and 1951 will be remembered in the history of football for Helenio Herrera’s 3-2-5 formation. Managers and coaches in those days were mostly peripheral figures and clubs were best known by its players.But the legendary Herrera rose beyond these, and was one of the first limelight-hogging coaches.

New Picture (3)
 
As soon as Herrera left Atlético to take charge of Malaga in 1952, the league became a tussle between László Kubala’s Barcelona and Alfredo di Stéfano’s Real Madrid.
Success in Europe kept eluding Atlético until 1962 when the club made it to the final of the European Cup Winners’ Cup. The final against Fiorentina at Hampden Park was hard fought and finished 1-1 after extra time. The replay, played four months later in Stuttgart, saw Atlético winning 3-0 to bag their first European title.Incidentally, it remains the only title to elude their more famous city rivals. They made it to the final in the next season as well but, sadly enough, got thrashed 5-1 by Tottenham Hotspur.

Atlético of the early 1960s was a great side. But those were also the best days for Real Madrid. However, even then, Atlético managed to beat Real Madrid in back-to-back Copa del Rey finals in 1960 and 1961. In 1964, Atlético appointed Vicente Calderón as its new president. He immediately signed some new players, most important among them being Luis Aragonés. They claimed the Copa del Rey in 1964-65 with an impressive run to the final against Real Madrid, Valencia, Real Sociedad, and Zaragoza. They won the league the next season, finishing a point ahead of Real Madrid. However,  they had to sell the Estadio Metropolitano in 1966 to clear some of financial mess that the club was in. Next season, Luis Aragonés scored their first goal in the new stadium, Estadio Manzanares, which was later renovated and renamed the  Estadio Vicente Calderón in 1971.
Argentina’s Boca Juniors’ iconic footballer and coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo took over the managerial responsibility of Atlético in 1973 and led them to their first European cup final  against Bayern Munich in Brussels next year. Atlético were without the suspended Ruben Ayala, Ruben Díaz, and Quique in that final.All these players had been sent off in an ill-tempered game against Celtic in the semifinal in Glasgow, which Atlético still managed to keep goalless. They won their home game 2-0 to book their place in the final. Let’s not forget that Bayern, at that time, had footballers like Sepp Maier, Paul Breitner, Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Uli Hoeneß in its starting line-up, but Atlético still took the lead with Aragonés’goal in the extra time. 30 seconds from the closing whistle, Bayern defender Georg Schwarzenbeck’s wonder strike from 25 yards beat the Atléti goalkeeper Miguel Reina and the game finished 1-1. The replay played just after 2 days on May 17th 1974 at the same venue,  and Bayern walked away with the title with its 4-0 win(2 goals each from Hoeneß and Müller).
Interestingly enough, Bayern refused to travel to Argentina to play against a physically tough Independiente side in the Intercontinental Cup, now known as the Club World Championship. As a result, Atlético got the chance and made the most out of it by winning the home match 2-0 with goals by Javier Irureta and Rubén Ayala. It was the first of many successes of Luis Aragonés who had retired and was promptly appointed as the Atlético coach.
In 1975-76, Aragonés’ men won their fifth Copa del Rey, and, in the following season got the league for the eighth time, beating Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona in a thrilling title race. What followed was the dreariest period in the club’s history.
After winning the league title in 1976-77, Atlético had just won a sole Copa del Rey in 1984-85 before Jesús Gil y Gil, the club’s most controversial president till date, took over in 1987. Fans were getting impatient and Gil came into power by promising to sign the Portuguese left winger Paulo Futre, a crucial member of the European Cup winner with F.C. Porto. They won the Copa del Rey in the consecutive years of 1991 and 1992, but the club was going through a financial mess and Gil kept buying players and sacking managers. One of Gil’s biggest blunders was to shut down Atlético’s famous youth academy in 1992—a move which prompted a certain 15-year-old academy player Raúl Gonzalez to join the city rivals and achieve international fame.Finally, after 19 years, the league was won in 1995-96. Copa del Rey was won that year as well, making it a double success for coach Radomir Antic’s Atlético. The team now had players like José Luis Caminero, Diego Simeone, Milinko Pantić, and Francisco Miguel Narváez Machón aka Kiko. This success followed further signings of Christian Vieri, Juninho Paulista, and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the following few seasons. These marquee but thoughtless signings, however, also pushed the club closer to bankruptcy.
While the club was in such an unstable state due to the shenanigans of Jesús Gil and his eponymous political party, GIL, ( ironically enough, IL stood for Independent Liberals)  some of the players were being investigated for undeclared incomes. Paulo Futre later admitted to receiving £2.5 million in backhander. To make things even worse, a member of the neo-Nazi group Bastion stabbed a Real Sociedad fan outside Vicente Calderón in 1998. The perpetrator was sentenced to 20 years’ jail in 2001.
Gil and his board members got suspended for various financial crimes, including embezzlement from his own club, in 1999.And Gil was finally arrested in 2000. The club’s performance on the pitch had also reached its nadir by then, with them getting relegated for Segunda in 1999-2000 after Hasselbaink failed to convert from the spot on the last day of the league against Real Oviedo. Claudio Ranieri, the manager, resigned. Once more, in stepped Aragonés, and got the club back in the top division after missing out the chance narrowly in the previous season. Gil’s ghost was still around Vicente Calderón as his son took charge of the club while he was busy clearing the multiple charges of financial malpractices brought against him. Fans, by that time, were well and truly sick of the corruption and had started chanting ‘Gil carbon, fuera del Calderón’(Gil, you bustard, get out of Calderon) during various games.
 
New Picture (4)

Finally, Gil resigned in May 2003 after sacking 36 managers (6 in one season) and leaving Atlético 80 million euros in debt a month after the official celebration of the club’s centenary. Although Real Madrid never considered Atlético to be a serious competitor, their ways of celebrating their centenaries provide certain interesting sociological perspectives. Real invited Plácido Domingo to sing in their centenary, while Rolling Stones rocked at Atlético’s. Real Madrid had a banquet whose invitees included the country’s president, members of royal family, and other VIPs, while Atlético cooked a giant paella and offered it to the crowd gathered outside the stadium for the game against Osasuna. Although they lost the game that day, the nature of the celebration suited a club that has never embraced any social pretensions.
Real Madrid had a banquet whose invitees included the country’s president, members of royal family, and other VIPs, while Atlético cooked a giant paella and offered it to the crowd gathered outside the stadium for the game against Osasuna.
Real Madrid’s indifference towards Atlético as a rival (which is mostly because Real wants to save it all for Barcelona) has always been treated as a snub by Atlético fans. These fans, along with  those of Sporting Gijón, are the most feared set of spectators in Spain. There is something unique and uninviting about Atlético fans. They prefer that you hate them. In fact, they thrive on it. Gil was a master at exploiting this ‘bad boys’ image to blame every lost game on politics and the referees’ association.
After coming back to the top division in Spain, we have seen inconsistent domestic performances from Atlético in spite of good footballers like Diego Forlán, Luis García, Simão, José Antonio Reyes, Sergio Agüero, and Radamel Falcao playing for them. They won the UEFA Europa League in 2009-10 and 2011-12, the second time under Diego Simeone, who seems poised to make Atlético a serious rival to both Real Madrid and Barcelona. Though whether they will be able to continue their last year’s performance is something that remains to be seen, it cannot be denied that they have done exceptionally well in the transfer market this season. They lost some of their key players, including their last season’s highest scorer Diego Costa to Chelsea. Their super goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois on loan from Chelsea has also gone back to his club. Full back Filipe Luís will play for the blues in London too. But they have signed enough players, including Mario Mandžukić, Antoine Griezmann, Miguel Ángel Moyà, Jan Oblak, Sílvio Manuel Pereira, and Jesús Gámez to back-fill. Simeone is clearly looking to create a solid squad that will not just be a one-season wonder.

Atlético Madrid will move out of Vicente Calderón and move to the renovated Estadio La Peineta in 2016. Fans are not excited about the shift but if the club continues to win trophies, they should hardly have anything to complain about. For now, only time will tell whether the mattress-makers manage to pose a serious threat to Real Madrid and their one-sided dominance of football in Madrid.

=== Out of the Real world (May 8th 1999) ===
By Richard Whittle
 
 
===== What does Atletico Madrid represent in Spain and throughout the world of football? =====
Madrid's other team and, to all Glasgow Celtic fans, one of the most vicious bunch of thugs ever to take the field in a European Cup tie. El Atleti have always lived under the giant shadow of Real; a pauper compared to Real's aristocracy. While Real are all style, Atletico have earned a reputation as the thought police of world football. However, times have changed and the likes of Juninho have blunted the hard edge.
 
===== Is this reputation justified? =====
Atletico have had to fight for everything. Franco favoured Real who deemed them unworthy of even rival status. The club has always been on the defensive, reflected by their choice of coaches. The master of the catenacio Helenio Herrera brought the club two Liga titles. Austrian disciplinarian Max Merkel followed him, but the club's uncompromising reputation was built around Juan Carlos Lorenzo. He played for the infamous Argentinian side, Estudaintes, in the late 60's and was more than eager to emplor the same tactics in Europe. They kicked their way to the European Cup final in 1974 before falling to Bayern Munich in a replay. Lorenzo's boys had two sent off in the semi-final against the Bhoys of Celtic and a reputation was cemented.
 
===== Who kept it going? =====
While the playing staff have failed to live up to the 70's hard-men, president Jesus Gil has kept the club in the headlines through fist-fights, public slanging matches and all manner of threats and outrageous proclamation.s Thirty coaches have come and gone since the mayor of Marbella took over in the mid-80s. He reduced Arrigo Sacchi to tears and early retirement, but has put his money where his mouth is and given his coaches untold financial backing. Radi Antic is a brave man though, returning for his second spell under the axe-man Gil.
 
===== How is the club financed and does the future look bright? =====
Gil's millions are evident all round the club. The city of Marbella sponsors the club and one of Gil's property development offices are under the main stand. As long as Gil keeps the money coming in Atletico won't have many sleepless nights.
 
==== THE PLAYERS ====
===== Who are the club's all-time greats? =====
Atletico are more famous for their coaches than players. Spain's greatest goalkeeper and national hero, Ricardo Zamora, led the team to two titles in the early 40s and Helenio Herrera did the same 10 years later. However, it is Vicente Calderon who deserves the greatest credit. The late president fought a constant battle to keep the club afloat while Real ruled the world. More recently, anyone from the title-winning team of 1996 is hailed as a hero.
 
===== Who is the cult hero? =====
Long-term injury victim Kiko in the many the team misses more than any other. The striker led the scoring charts when the club won the title in '96 and until his ankles gave out this season he was still the fans' favourite. Christian Vieri nearly won that honour, but when he quit the club for Lazio his name became dirt.
 
===== Who is the current crowd favourite? =====
In a team of international stars it is the young Spanish striker Jose Mari who gets the fans to their feet. His perfect balance, quick feet and incisive dribbling have drawn comparisons to Michael Laudrup. Roberto, who can play either on the right of midfield or up front, is another rising star. Juninho will always be a favourite and is finally returning to his pre-injury form.
 
===== Who to throw your Tortilla at? =====
With the players losing their Sacchi inhibitions the season is looking much brighter. The Italian coach dropped Juninho and left the young players out in favour of his countrymen. Temporary coach Carlos Sanchez Aguiar brought back the Brazilian, dropped the ineffective central defender Torrisi and told everyone to have a bit of fun. Now Antic has got Atletico playing enterprising football again.
==== THE STADIUM ====
===== Describe the local area =====
The industrial south-west of the city doesn’t have many attractions and the area around the Estadio Vicente Calderon is grim and colourless. The stadium is tucked in between the Manzanares river and a series of sweeping dual carriageways. Although the San Isidro cemetery is on one side and the local Mahou brewery on the other, the Calderon does have a faded charm of its own. The red-and-white striped façade needs a lick of paint, but the bars below the stand are real working-class shrines to the club. It may not have the glamour of the Bernabeu, but there is a down-to-earth feeling and there’s even a bar inside the ground selling Mahou beer, or course.
 
===== How do you get to the stadium? =====
It’s not far from the old centre of the city and the excellent metro network takes you there in no time. Take Metro Line 5 to Piramides then head right across the large Glorieta de las Piramides roundabout. You won’t see the stadium until you are halfway down the hill, but when you do it looks like a giant circus tent.
 
===== What is the view like? =====
Even with a capacity of 62,000 the all-seater Calderon feels quite compact. The steep tiers offer good views but be warned: three sides are uncovered. The covered side is called the preferente with the palco preference B being the most expensive at around 9,000 ptas. A VIP box with room for 25 seats has just been opened and there are plans for further expansion. At the other end of the scale, behind the goals in the anfiteatro de fonde norte or sur the views are still excellent and you get closer to the ultra culture. Prices start at around 3,000 ptas. The Atletico hardcore head to the fonde sur, so it’s worth going to the fonde norte to take in the choreography at the other end.
 
===== How easy is it to get a ticket? =====
Unless Real or Barcelona are the visitors, there are no problems getting a ticket even on match day. The main ticket offices are at gates 8 and 68 and there are always touts who can easily e knocked down in price nearer kick-off. Remember, Liga games generally kick-off on a Sunday at five in the evening, or seven in the spring and early summer.
 
===== What have been the highlights? =====
Few and far between with the last memorable back in 1996, after the Liga title was secured. Around 200,000 fans converged on the Vicente Calderon to celebrate. It was also used in the 1982 World Cup when France strutted their stuff against Northern Ireland and Austria.
 
==== THE FANS ====
===== How do Atletico fans compare with their rivals? =====
Los colchoneros (the Mattress Makers) – so named after their red and white shirts originally borrowed from Athletic Bilbao – have one of the best-organized and colourful followings around. The main ultra group, El Frente Atletico (the Atletico Heads), who stand in the fonde sur, are the closest thing to Italian ultras in Spain. They sing and chant for the full 90 minutes, wave the red, white and blue flags and bash out an incessant drumbeat, backed by what seems to be native-American chanting. There is even a racoon mascot dressed in a native-American headgear who runs on before kick-off to gee everyone up.
 
===== It sounds more like an American university game? =====
Not quite. They also have repertoire of cheesy 70s pop songs. They may like to sit and be entertained in the Bernabeu, but in the Calderon they want to get involved.
 
===== Are they disliked as much as Real Madrid fans? =====
Just about. Atletico have a strong travelling support which has made its presence felt at away games. Like Real fans, they sing about Madrid’s regional pride which doesn’t go down well in other parts of their country.
 
===== How do they get on with their city rivals? =====
Atletico draw their support from the solid working-class districts in the centre and south of the city. They are proud that the club wears the city’s emblem on their shirts. As Real think a game against Barcelona is more important, el Atleti will do anything to put one over them. Real’s exit from the Champions’ League this season caused just as frenzied celebrations as Atletico’s victory over Roma in the UEFA Cup. A derby game is still the most important to win – even if it is only for vocal and colourful support.
 
===== Do you rate their kit? =====
You’ll certainly stand out in the crowd wearing the famous red-and-white shirts. The stripes on the sleeves have been replaced with faded-red that darkens towards the cuffs. The blue shorts are stylish and baggy. Of course, the mark of Gil is on the front of the shirt, but it’s still a cool kit.
 
===== What kind of media coverage do Atletico receive and how are they perceived by the media? =====
It takes something like winning the Liga title or a Gil outburst for Atletico to make the front pages of the Madrid-based newspapers Marca and AS. You will have to dig back into around page 10 to find news on the club and then it is never as interesting or  as outlandish as Real’s coverage.

GIL FAMILY: 25 YEARS IN THE BOX OF THE CALDERON (Now almost 30)
In the start of June 1987, Brian De Palma just aired “The Untouchables” for the first time, a movie ambiented in the 30s with the Dry Law in the USA, which was awarded with 4 nominations for the Oscars (Sean Connery got one for Best Actor in Supporting Role). In those days, Madonna was touring in Japan, Whitney Houston was smashing selling records in the US with her new album, and, in Spain, David Bowie managed to get to the first position in Los 40 Principales list (quite surprising considering that's a radio for mainstream music). Talking about sports, Wimbledon had a massive surprise for us when Ivan Lendl, who was at that time in a more than 2 year streak of best ATP player, lost in 3 sets against the aussie Pat Cash.
That same June of 1987, day 27, D. Jesus Gil was elected as the president of Atletico de Madrid. An appoinment which lead, a few years later, an endless list of judicial processes, fraud and misaproppiation accusations, faked documents, uses of club's money to his own return, inflations of the price of some players who never were professionals, of taking a club which was considered one of the 3 or 4 best teams in Spain, to lift only 6 trophies in 25 years, with a relegation included. This is the case of Gil family, joined very tight to the name of Enrique Cerezo, up front of a Sports Limited Company (SAD, Sociedad Anonima Deportiva), before a Football Club. It's the history of how a club owned by their socios ended in the hands of managers who never paid for it. It's a narration that lots of people know, but disgracefully, not everybody knows.
25 YEARS OF HISTORY: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FOOTBALL TEAM AND THE TRIBUNALS
“The socio has reacted. This is the beginning of a huge transformation, the starting of a new era”
                          Jesus Gil, June 27th of 1987
1987: JESUS GIL IS ELECTED AS THE PRESIDENT OF ATLETICO DE MADRID
The elections were held that 27 of June, with 4 candidates committing to it:
*D. Enrique Sanchez de Leon, who were a Health Minister between 1977 and 1979, during the first government of Adolfo Suarez (Spanish transition guy)
*D. Jesus Gil y Gil, real estate promoter. He was convicted of the collapse of a ceilling in Los Angeles de San Rafael in 1969 where 56 people died.
*D. Agustin Cotorruelo, son of the socio number 1, Commerce Minister during Carrero Blanco's presidency (1973, Franco still alive). He was the president of the club during 3 months in 1982 while everyone was preparing the return of Vicente Calderon.
*D. Salvador Santos Campano, Vicepresident of the club for more than 15 years, and ex player of the handball sections in the 70s.
That day, at 18:45, the results were known and with a total of 12.476 votes.
How could Jesus Gil win those elections when he was the one with the lesser curriculum? To answer this question, we have to travel to Portugal, to Oporto. It was there where one of the best players of that time, Paolo Futre, awarded with 2 best player award of the portuguese league, league champion 2 times, and what made him famous, european champion in that year in a thrilling final against the allmighty Bayern Munich.
He debuted in 1983 with Sporting CP, where he only remained one year because of a supposed raise of wages he asked for. Three seasons in Oporto and then a millionaire contract with Atletico, 4 seasons with a wage of 120 million pesetas each year (that was hell of a lot back then) and a chalet. His transfer was 500 million pesetas, the highest for a portuguese player at that time. Jesus Gil travelled himself to Portugal to close the deal and he brang Futre to Madrid, where the team played the cup final a day later of that elections. He can't play, but he had to start rentabilising the transfer and inspiring hope to the supporters was the first step.
Atleti lost that final, where we played in Zaragoza against Real Sociedad. Game time ended with a 2-2 score which lead the game to the penalty shootout. Then Arconada was made a hero (he was a very good keeper) and John Benjamin Toshack made history making la Real win his 2nd Copa del Rey (first one was in 1909).
1992: CLUB IS CONVERTED INTO A SLC
5 seasons after the arrival of Jesus Gil, and with 14 changes of coach in those years, October 30th of 1992 was the deadline day for clubs to convert into SAD, as said in the Sports Law of 1990. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic and Osasuna were not forced into it, since they have positive net patrimonial value at that time. This law forced the other teams in first and second division to convert into SAD so the waste of money that some presidents made should end.
June 28th 1992: This date is largely remembered by Atleti fans. That day Atleti won his 2nd straight Copa del Rey. If one year before the rival was Mallorca in the Santiago Bernabeu (we like winning there), with a 1-0 victory for us, that time we faced our rivals, Real Madrid, in the same scenario. We won the cup with Schuster goal from a free kick and a Futre lef footed shot.
At the end of this second phase of transformation, Atleti had covered only a 5% of his social capital (102 million pesetas). Facing third phase, which should be open, the board decided that only the actual socios could apply for it. Time expired 29th. After that, and depending of how much of that capital was covered, Gil would buy the rest of the club shares, club sources told. “President's idea is to give some opportunity for the socios” said those sources. We have to point that in that year the socio fee raised a solid 65% from last season, so a lot of people didn't renew his, which lead to a major decrease in the number of socios who could opt for some shares.
29th June 1992: As Jose Miguelez published in El Pais (sorry, i searched for the article but i couldn't find nothing :()”all the consulted club sources, except for Jesus Gil, assure that he has all the money to buy the remaining shares (1.960 million pesetas), but no official confirmation. The oposition, meanwhile, offer themselves to put the money if Gil leaves. The problem is that deadline is close and if Atletico don't meet it, they would play in the 3rd division.
“You all know that we have money problems. But we are going to solve it. We the poors have also the right to be happy and eat caviar” Jesus Gil, June 29th of 1992 (Again, i couldn't find a source for this. But this wikiquote is hilarious if you understand spanish)
In an atmosphere of euphoria after beating our long time rival, from the board were sent pesimistic messages about the financial state of the club. Social capital ascended to 2.060 million pesetas, and the socios only covered a 5%. If there were troubles finding the money, why wasn't the third phase open to everybody and they decided to made it only for the socios? Gil repeated one time and another that the club was in a very tight economic situation, although he showed himself as the hero we needed, the one who would put the money to save Atletico from the relegation to the third tier because of its debts.
June 30th, 1992:(El País): “All the sources asked from the club, except Gil, insist about afirming that the president has the money. But, CSD (Consejo Superior de Deportes, main sport org here) at the end of the day only had bad news. In an attitude that some people close to him feel as faked for a better ending. Gil showed himself very pessimistic about his managements. “In these moments”, he said,”i haven't solved the problem. I'm worried about Caja Madrid (now Bankia) not answering my credit demand. I think i'm paying the price of being in politics. But, anyway, i've got more solutions. We'll keep on fighting. If i don't achieve it now, i'll ask, according to the law, a temporal exception”. Yesterday, Joaquin Leguina (Comunidad de Madrid president) made for sure the conversion into SLC when meeted in the celebration of the Cup won a few days ago.”Go calmed to holidays, next year you'll carry on” he said.”
Marca: “For Jesus Gil is redeem. He is seeking desperately for those 2.000 millions that'll allow the conversion of his club in a SLC. To the downgrade in the sports side you should add the economic one. Atleti would be excluded of the Plan de Saneamiento (a plan made to quit club debts) so it should face its debts of 3.269 million pesetas with Seguridad Social and Hacienda and which would be made effective inmediatly.”
JULY 1st, 1992: 200 MILLIONS AND A DRESSING GOWN
Money put on each SLC
July 1st, 1992 (El País): “Jesus Gil, Atleti president, arrived to the CSD 10 minutes before the deadline expired. Few minutes before, club's lawyer, Jose Luis Sierra, presented in the register the deeds for the conversion. There are 3 bank certificates cited in those deeds: One of Banco Central Hispano (now Banco Santander), for 120 million pesetas, for the shares remaining. The other two were mortgages, one for 1.300 millions and the other one for 713, being Credit Lyonais and Vitoria Bank respectively.
”The dressing gown is made of silk, was a present of my wife, and the slippers are from Loewe” Ruiz Mateos, Rayo president at that time
Context of the quote
That photo was taken in June 20th, a few minutes after the time for teams to convert into SLC ended. There we can see Jesus Gil and Jose Maria Ruiz Mateos, Atleti and Rayo majority shareholders, respectively. What is curious about this photo is that they are the two presidents of the SLC with less socio percentage shared (Atleti 5% and Rayo 2%).
“Football should stop being every Sunday battle. Here we stop the tissue thing against the board. > When one shows the tissue, the other shows the actions...” Jesus Gil, July 8th 1992
SEASON 1999-2000: JUDICIAL INTERVENTION
December 22th in 1999 (Lotto day here), Manuel Garcia Castellon, Audiencia Nacional judge (one of the highest instances of law in Spain), decreed the destitution of the president, Jesus Gil, and all of the board members, and the intervention and seizure of Atletico de Madrid shares. Manuel Garcia Castellon named Luis Manuel Rubi as the judicial administrator with full powers until March 31, 2000 to take over the management of the club while the crimes were being investigated, which the prosecutors accounted to be 9.427 million pesetas.
April 11th, 2000 the judge dictated the end of the judicial intervention and the return of Jesus Gil as a president. As of that, Rubi left the club and the control was passed to the Gil family, although all the operations would be supervised by two inspectors who should agree certain operations.
As ABC said in December 23rd, 1999, and according to a deed presented by the Audiencia Nacional prosecutor, Carlos Castresana, “at the end of 1997 Jesus Gil had debts with Atleti for 2.700 millions. After that, in January 1998 Gil decided to pay off his debts with the general manager of the club, his son Miguel Angel (now in charge). But he didn't make that paying it, instead, according to the prosecutor, he loaned to his own club some players throught his company Promociones Deportivas who were assessed by him and his son for 2.740 million pesetas, when the price of those footballers should be infintely less, if not almost zero”. This case of assessing those footballers in 2.740 millions is called “Caso Negritos”, which was judged with the misaproppiation of the club of Jesus Gil and Enrique Cerezo in the “Caso Atletico”.
2003: CASO ATLETICO SENTENCE
February 14th, 2003, Audiencia Nacional condemned Jesus Gil to 3 years and a half in jail for misaproppiation and fraud, to give away to the club his 236.056 shares and to get a debt of 2.700 million pesetas of Caso Negritos. Enrique Cerezo was also condemned as a necesary cooperator for the misaproppiation (12 months of prison) and Miguel Angel Gil Marin too (fraud crime simulating contracts, 18 months of jail). The effects of these depend on the decision of the Tribunal Supremo (the highest instance i think with the Constitucional), which would arrive in middle 2004.
2004: FINAL DECISION OF TRIBUNAL SUPREMO
The sentence of the Tribunal Supremo was to absolve both Jesus Gil and Enrique Cerezo, considering that their crimes of misappropiation had prescribed. However, they mantained the condemn over Miguel Angel Gil Marin for the contract simulation, as well as the obligation to recover the financial state before the signing, when that reflected a debt of 2.700 millions of Jesus Gil with the club, being acquierd by his son Miguel Angel Gil and all other inheritors. (Jesus Gil died in May 14th of a brain stroke)
“They have accused us of being thieves and i say only one thing: you only can steal where you >can, and the prosecutor thought that here there would be oil (referring to a big business) and he >only found hard work” Enrique Cerezo, July 9th 2004
In page 36 of the sentence we can read the following:
“Jesus Gil got his shares in a fraudulent way, without spending any money, as it has been accredited, even the crime of misappropiation has prescribed, but Atletico de Madrid, like many others, has a story and inmaterial values, which trascend and overcome its mere economic influence. Definitely, father and son, with manifested abuse, disloyalty and preconception suscribed both of them the contract which formally had two parts, but with the club one being used for their interests and not the club's ones, so, in fact, the debt was condoned in prejudice of the club.”
And well, the Miguel Angel history as the club director i think we al kinda know. “Best Sports Manager of the year” according to Globe Soccer when we achieved the 2 titles and they sold almost everyone, and some shady things with Mendes and investment funds...

Following the results of the 2nd r/atletico survey it is possible that many subscribers were left wondering about the question on the current board of directors. Why? Aren’t we doing great lately? Especially notable is the difference between respondents from the Madrid area and the rest of the world.
My personal opinion is that someone is doing their job really well at Atleti. Ever since Torres was sold, almost all signings have been spot-on, creating value both on the pitch and in the treasury of the club. The fan base is expanding, we have good results and reducing our huge debt. Simeone was a gift of the gods, but let’s not forget that before him Aguirre put us back in Champions League and Quique made us champions after 15 years, which is something many of us feared would never happen again.
I don’t think the mastermind behind this is either the president Cerezo or CEO and majority shareholder Gil Marín. However, at the very least, we need to give them credit for letting the right people do their job and not interfering with them. Someone is finally thinking long-run and our current good situation is a result of it.
Why can’t many people forgive them? I’m starting this series so that r/atletico knows the history of how Gil Marín’s father (Jesús Gil) became president of the fan-owned club by popular vote and then, together with Cerezo, transformed it into a private company fully owned by himself. He had tons of problems with justice, went to prison several times and the club was found to be used as a money laundering machine, which ended with a judicial administration and a relegation to Segunda División that same year. Notice that I’m not saying “allegedly” because all of this was judged and all appeals are final. That's the tl;dr if you want to stop here.
This is not really OC; I’m basing it on a brilliant series by the user Garate9 in the colchonero.com forum (link to the Spanish original). However, that series was aimed at a different public – people familiar with most of the names and with Spanish politics and justice system. I’m not translating directly: I’m simplifying some things, cutting some others and giving some background where I think a non-Spanish fan may need it.
The original series had 8 chapters and was super long. I'll try to make this one as shorter and readable as possible, but the story is still complex and I don't want to miss important details. Also, I found that there are almost no sources about this in English in the whole internet, so someone has to be the first.
Chapter 1. Gil becomes president
To understand why Gil won the 1987 election we need to think of the situation those years. Atleti was in a decadence phase after the glorious decade of the 70s. Since the early 80s, Atleti had started to sell its most prominent players in order to make ends meet and refrain from expensive signings.
In this context, Vicente Calderón (yes, the one after whom the stadium is named, who had been president during the best years) had to come back to put some order in 1982. Despite these financial problems, a very decent team was arranged thanks to the excellent academy we had, and a couple of good signings. That team managed to stay at the top side of the table, but was never really a challenger for the league. In fact, the 80s ended with no titles, except for the Cup of 1985.
Calderón’s last season (1986/87) was terrible in league, where we finished out of the top group and could not contend for the top six spots (it was the only Spanish league to ever be played with a play-off system). We made it to the Cup final, but at that moment it felt like a lottery that had just gone lucky.
In this atmosphere of low morale, Calderón passed away and new elections were called. Several candidates were contending, but what really made the difference was Jesús Gil’s commitment to sign Paulo Futre at his own expense. Futre was the star of Porto, who had just shocked the world in the European Cup final against Bayern with skills comparable to Maradona’s.
All candidates promised great things, but this one put his money where his mouth was and came forward with a binding contract with Futre. The majority of fans voted for him for this reason, and he delivered.
Other of his big projects were to make the club more profitable by mass sponsoring, opening luxury restaurants in the stadium or even making the Manzanares river navigable and opening boat restaurants (!?). In a way, he was a visionary of modern football.
But, who was Jesús Gil anyway? Let’s stop the story for a moment.
He was a major celebrity in Spain, but maybe you guys need some introduction. It’s difficult to describe him with words: self-made man, trashy, funny, morbidly obese, hot-headed, showman, tacky, irreverent, simple, corrupt, witty… all of them fit. But sometimes an image talks louder than words. Jesús Gil was, over all things, this guy. He was also this guy and this guy.
I watch this and I can’t stay mad at him. After all, he was a very funny and relatable man. He had his own TV show where he appeared giving the least appropriate life advice. He talked about his time in prison the same way you would talk about your holidays. Most importantly he was one of us. He was the exact opposite of the posh madridista stereotype. He hated Real Madrid’s guts and wouldn’t care to say it out loud. He enjoyed every minute of being Atleti’s president. He repeated constantly how he wanted to be buried in the Atleti flag he kept in his office, and he apparently was when he died in 2004 (SIDE NOTE: I say apparently because, like Elvis, there’s a myth about him faking his own death to escape justice. Everyone always considered it a legend until last year, when this video was captured. That’s Villar, president of the Spanish FA, asking Gil Marín “How’s your father doing?”, to which he replies “Fine, fine.” WHAT. THE. FUCK.)
He made an impressive career as a real estate developer, which earned him a big fortune and also his first spell in prison (1969-1971) when a building of his star development project collapsed due to faulty materials, killing 56.
Around the time he was planning the conversion of Atleti into a private company, he created his own political party, whose initials were his name: GIL (Grupo Independiente Liberal – classy as fuck). He won a majority in the town of Marbella, home of some of the most exclusive compounds in the Costa del Sol, basically by pumping money like no other local campaign had ever done. It is said that he would go to every bar in town, order a coffee, chat around with everyone, pay with a banknote of 10,000 pesetas and leave the change as a tip (coffee was ca. 100 pesetas). He was a whole new level of populism.
Any mayor during the golden years of the Spanish real estate bubble had chances to be corrupt. They had the power to reassign land plots for building purposes, which made their prices skyrocket. The clear confusion of interests between local governments, savings banks and real estate developers led to one of the most shameful episodes of our recent history. But Gil took it to the next stage. Marbella boomed as a center for high-end leisure and attracted all sorts of sketchy real estate investors. Among them it is said the Russian mob, who would have taken advantage of the vicinity to Gibraltar and made Marbella its headquarters in Western Europe. Corruption became the system, but since money didn’t stop coming, it was sustainable and every single layer of local government benefitted from it. In the short term, it looked like Marbella was swimming in money. He won two re-elections as mayor that way.
When shit hit the fan in the 2000s, the Spanish government had to dissolve the municipality and appoint external administrators for the town, because every single elected official (GIL’s and opposition) was either in prison or indicted in the largest corruption proceedings known to date in Spanish judicial history.
Well, now you know the man. It's important because the connection between Marbella and Atleti is a key part of the story. Let’s leave it for the next chapter.

On my last post we learnt about who was Jesús Gil and how he became Atleti’s president in the first place. Today we will see how he went from president to owner. Again, credit to Garate9 of colchonero.com. This translation/adaptation is based on his work.
Chapter 2. Atlético’s transformation into a private company.
We left the story when Gil brought Futre. He went on to sign some other big names, but most of them past their prime like Goikoetxea and López Ufarte (not to miss for Armando Ufarte, Atleti legend from the 60/70s). He also fired Luis Aragonés as coach. These first years are marked by turmoil, constant changes of manager, including an uprising by the squad which ended in the sale of several important players that were very poorly replaced.
Some mediocre years came until 90/91, with the signings of Vizcaíno and Schuster. On that season we ended as runner-ups in league and won the Cup after eliminating Barcelona and Real Madrid. For the next year, good news: Luis Aragonés was hired as coach again.
Season 91/92 was the best in many years. We ended second again after fighting for the league until the very end, but most importantly, we beat Real Madrid in the Cup final at Santiago Bernabéu. This is one of the historic matches of Atlético with goals by Futre and Schuster, with Luis on the bench.
Gil seemed to have finally touched the right key and he was popular among the fans. It’s around this time when Gil put in place the plan he had in mind since the very beginning: transforming the club into a company and becoming owner of it.
Explanation: football teams had been historically organized in the legal form of “sports clubs”. A sports club has autonomy to dictate its own rules and to accept members at its will, who become owners of a proportional share of the club. The main difference between a club and a company is that clubs accept members personally and all members are strictly equal and can’t accumulate more than one share. Companies follow the capitalistic logic, where shares are tradable assets that can be exchanged for money and be accumulated.
In the 80s and early 90s almost all clubs in the Spanish league were highly indebted; and Atleti was no exception. It was argued that the legal form of sports clubs was inefficient by modern standards, because it diluted the responsibility and created wrong incentives. In a way it seems true; as fans we care exclusively for the sports results and tend to neglect the financial part of the game, which (it was argued) was the cause for the irresponsible indebtedness. Converting clubs into companies would solve the problem, because the owners of shares would care both for the sports part (as it is the main source of revenue) but also of the long term fiscal soundness of the entity. In principle, nothing prevented from allotting one share of the company to each member of the club, so that the property could theoretically still remain with the fan base.
(BTW time has proven this hypothesis wrong).
Gil was one of the proponents of this solution and he promoted it strongly with the help of the most famous sports pundit at the time in Spain, who was friends with him. They lobbied for it and sold it as the miracle solution for all of football’s problems. In 1990 a law was passed whereby all sports clubs playing in professional leagues (1st and 2nd division in the case of football) needed to become companies by 1992, except the ones who had positive financial results for the last 4 leagues (a taylor-made exception for guess who).
A special type of company was regulated for this purpose (sports company), but if you read the law, it really is fundamentally the same as any other commercial company except for a few reporting requirements, and the minimum share capital (think Eibar last year).
So the transformation had to start. Gil was granted authorization to skip the 1991 election because of this, although, to be honest, he would most probably have won. But here is the catch: in order to clean the balance sheets of the clubs, the new companies would have to start over with a share capital that set-off the current debt. In other words, if a club was worth 500 million, but owed other 500 million, the new company could not have a share capital of 500 million and just assume the debt; it needed to have a capital of 1000 million.
Given the huge debt of many clubs, the high price to pay for the same share of the company discouraged current members (socios) from buying shares of the new companies. Only a very small minority of shares were sold among the former socios, as Gil expected. With this situation, the deadline for the incorporation of the company (30 June) came close and Atleti was nearly 2,000 million pesetas short in share capital (12 mio € not counting inflation, a lot back then). This meant the disqualification to play professional football, i.e., the team that had just amazed the world with Schuster and Futre’s goals in the Cup final against Madrid at Bernabéu was going to be relegated to the third division (2ª B). This was the thrill Gil wanted to make his appearance.
Everybody was expecting that he would somehow manage to avert the disaster. At the very last moment, 15 minutes before midnight, Gil appeared as a savior and saved the day. It was the perfect image for him: without Gil, Atleti was doomed; Gil had saved Atleti; Gil was Atleti.
There are two stories about how this happened:
1- Gil’s “official” story: at the very last minute, he obtained a credit by putting all his personal fortune as guarantee, bought the remaining shares and saved the team (and coincidentally became its owner).
2- The story that the Supreme Court of Spain considered as proven in its judgment of 4 June 2004: Gil and Cerezo were co-authors of a crime of undue appropriation and took advantage of their position in the club to divert money from it and make it pay for itself (in their names).
What you need to understand here is that in Spanish criminal law all felonies EXPIRE. This means, if there is no prosecution started within a certain number of years, no charges can be pressed anymore. Public opinion rages often about this, but most legal professionals consider it necessary.
The thing is, it is not always super clear when a crime was “completed” and the clock for the expiration starts ticking, especially with financial crimes. So in this case, Gil’s defense lost in the first and second instance courts, which considered the crime not expired and went on to judge him as guilty. After appealing, the Supreme Court had a more favorable interpretation about the expiration date and released him of charges on the basis of expiry alone, but did not contradict that the facts had happened. This resulted in the odd situation of a judgment saying “well, we know this happened but we can’t punish you” (in a normal situation, courts don’t even judge the facts if they have expired, so there’s no “guilty” or “innocent” verdict).
So, how did he do it? We’ll let the Supreme Court speak for itself:
“When he first gained the presidency, Jesús Gil had decided to make the club his property. For that purpose, he tried to confuse the club’s estate with his own.” (…)
“With this intent, Jesús Gil, assisted by Enrique Cerezo, made Atlético de Madrid recognize debts in his favor, not previously reflected in the club’s accounts, by means of deeds signed before public notaries…”
To summarize, by 1992 Gil was a creditor of the club for around 2,000 mio pesetas, corresponding to federative rights for players he claims to have paid with his personal money and then assigned to the club. All of this under recognition by the club (i.e. Cerezo).
Gil wanted to pay for the shares of the new company by cancelling the supposed debt he had against the club, which coincidentally is around the same amount that was required for the minimum share capital. The sports authorities refuse, because with a higher debt, the necessary share capital would rise to 4,000 mio.
“When Jesús Gil realized that his plan to obtain the property of the new company via debt set-off was not feasible, he sought a new solution for this purpose…”
That new solution consisted in the club assigning Jesús Gil the federative rights of all 30 players in the team (à la third-party ownership) as a payment for the fake debt. Then, as soon as the club would be transformed into a sports company, he would re-sell them to the team for an amount equivalent to what he had to pay in exchange for the shares of the new company.
“This transaction was made to avoid complying with the legal requirements of the transformation of clubs into companies, both in relation to the calculation of the minimum share capital, and to the actual payment of such capital. Jesús Gil would so be immediately reimbursed of the money he paid for the shares with the re-sale of the federative rights of the players…”
“Since the payments had no other function than simulating the purchase of the share capital, in order to have them immediately reimbursed, Jesús Gil wrote a letter on 30 June 1992 to the bank Banco de Vitoria requesting, as president of the new company, the repayment to his own personal account of 1,300 mio in exchange for the federative rights of the players" (…)
Similarly, another letter was sent to Credit Lyonnais on 3 July 1992 requesting the repayment of 650 mio to Enrique Cerezo, for the same concepts (…).
Jesús Gil and Enrique Cerezo had signed a different agreement whereby the latter sold his recently acquired shares to the former (…). This way, Jesús Gil became owner of 95% of the shares, without him or Enrique Cerezo having executed an actual payment of either 1,300 mio or 650 mio., and thanks to the debts he had been recognized in his favor…”
To summarize:
A- Gil and Cerezo buy the shares with a loan for 2,000 million pesetas.
B- Gil charges Atletico de Madrid plc 2,000 million pesetas for the re-sale of its own players.
C- Gil and Cerezo return the 2,000 million and Gil buys Cerezo his stake, as previously agreed. He did sell him later 9% of his 95%.
Result: Gil becomes owner of Atlético de Madrid with money coming from the club itself. Nothing can be done now, since no one claimed against it until it was too late.
You might think that this trick had in fact saved Atleti. This is what many people thought and why most fans supported Gil for many many years. At the end of the day, if it's for the better and it doesn't affect the team's results, maybe it's forgivable. For the last chapter we will see that in fact Atleti's judicial history only starts there. The worst was yet to come.

==== [History time] The rollercoaster of the 90's. (Part 3 of the Gil saga) self.atletico ====
submitted 1 year ago by maeseCaracórner
On the first part of the series we learnt about how Jesús Gil became president, and on the second part how the Spanish justice considered proven that he used his position to become owner of Atleti fraudulently. My initial idea was to just write 3 episodes on the history of the legal problems of the club and only mention the sports part lightly. I decided to add an additional episode about how the team did during these years to give a bit more of context. Also we get to revisit some great moments (yay!!).
Again, credit to Garate9 of colchonero.com. This translation/adaptation is based on his work.
===== Chapter 3: The rollercoaster before the downfall =====
Before discussing the legal stuff, we left the story in 1992, with a remarkable Cup champion squad, two international stars (Futre and Schuster), both of Spain’s centerbacks and a great project led by Atleti legend Luis Aragonés.
Gil had just “saved” the team and it looked like we had someone sensible in charge, we were building a great squad and had solid project. We were back to our place. Sadly, 92/93 was a terrible year. After a great start in league and CWC, a bad streak put us behind in the table. A bad match drawn against Madrid at home tipped the scale. Luis criticized Futre’s apathy and they argued. Gil supported the coach. As a result, Futre was sold to Benfica, which proved a bad move for both Atleti and him.
That was the “official” story. Now I’ll give you just a taste of how Gil’s dirty businesses affected the team on the pitch: years later, when responding before justice about his corruption scandals in Marbella (the posh holiday town Gil was mayor of, remember part 1), Gil declared that “I have never taken any money from Marbella to Atlético; all the contrary. I had to sell Futre in order to pay the town’s salaries because it was broke.” That's just great.
In fact, they had clashing characters, but they weren't enemies. Futre himself re-hired Aragonés as a coach when he was sports director in the 2000s, and when asked about their bad relationship in the past he answered that his signing for Benfica had nothing to do with Luis and, as far as he knew, it was caused by financial problems. He even dedicated him a very touching obituary (Spanish only, sorry).
Well, Luis resigned after another terrible match against Barça and Schuster saw the panorama and left as soon as he could. Another great project in ruins.
Some terrible signings followed the next few years and again, chronic instability. In 93/94 we had six different coaches. In 94/95 we had Maturana, the successful Colombian coach who impressed the world in the USA World Cup. He asked for Klinsmann and the German was willing to sign, but then Gil said that his alleged homosexuality could be a problem in the dressing room. Well, he said it with different, blunter words.
Those two seasons we were really close of playing the relegation play-off (4 points and 1 point), and were only saved in the last few weeks.
95/96. Our new coach Radomir Antic came to this desolation. The signings that year were unimpressive. Molina and Santi, from the almost relegated Albacete. Penev, discarded from Valencia and coming out of an illness. Pantic, a complete unknown Serbian, personal request from Antic. Biagini, Correa, Roberto, promising but untested.
Well, these questionable signings, together with the guys who had been struggling to avoid relegation for two years, would end up forming the line-up every single colchonero (old enough) can recite by heart: Molina, Toni, Geli, Solozábal, Santi, Vizcaíno, Caminero, Simeone, Pantic, Kiko, Penev.
For the first half of the season we were a machine, with the “advantage” of not playing in Europe, we seemed like safe champions by February. Then the important Cup fixtures started, including a legendary match against Valencia, and fatigue started to take its toll (the XI above almost never changed). Add to this that that year the league featured 22 teams and lasted 42 weeks (Celta and Sevilla were supposed to be relegated for administrative reasons but the FA backed off last minute). Similarly to 2014, we could have closed the deal weeks in advance, but nerves failed. Week 41 we draw against Tenerife. Aguilera, rojiblanco at heart, missed a clear chance that would have complicated things enormously. Last match against the weak Albacete. We needed a victory and we didn’t miss this time. Extasis.
As for the Cup, we had eliminated fierce opposition towards the final against Barcelona. That match was extremely hard, went on to extra time and was decided by Pantic’s only header goal in his whole career. What a way of winning a final! A goal by the undisputed MVP of the season, unknown to the world just a few months ago!
Only double in our history. Gil ordered a bust of Pantic to be sculpted in remembrance, and this bouquet of fresh flowers still appears every single match on the south-east corner in his honor, brought by this adorable lady. Don’t dare to touch it or the Calderón will be all over you.
The following year started full of excitement for our participation in Champions League for the first time in many years. With some reinforcements (even Ronaldo was in the pipeline but Barça intervened), the backbone of that champion squad remained. The team was not up to the expectations: we were out of the fight for the league soon and Barça eliminated us in Cup with a hysterical 5-4. In Champions League we faced Ajax, a powerhouse back then, in quarterfinals. We drew 1-1 in Amsterdam and lost to an extra time goal at home, after a missed penalty by Esnáider. It was hard at the moment because expectations were high, but all in all it was not a terrible year, considering what came later.
97/98 saw some impressive signings: Juninho, Lardín and Vieri. Even Futre was back! Only the Italian lived up to the expectations, with beauties such as this one. Juninho started too focused in Brazil NT, had some injuries and was ultimately wrecked by Celta’s (later Madrid’s) Míchel Salgado. It was a shame because that guy was on his way to be a superstar. Lardín was a huge disappointment. Futre was way past his prime and very conflictive, he eventually left to Japan.
The midfield suffered without Simeone. It was a very inconsistent year with great matches followed by terrible matches. We made it to the UEFA semifinals though, but at the end of the year Antic, Geli, Pantic, Caminero and Vizcaíno left. In two years there was nothing remaining from that legendary double squad.
Just before the start of the following season Vieri leaves and is not replaced. The fans were confused: where did the money go? Arrigo Sacchi was the new coach, but he lasted less than a year. Antic came back after him and the season ended with a Cup final very badly lost against Valencia.
One word defines this era: inconsistency. The team was never bad, we were undisputedly the third “biggest” team in Spain (the dispute for the 2nd place was definitely lost to Barcelona in the 80s), and had enough prestige and fanbase to attract first line players. But no project seemed to last. At least twice in these 8 years we had top-class squads capable of absolutely anything. Both times the project was in shambles when the first obstacles came. Every season seemed like a lottery. Still, we got to see our best year ever, some European action and some finals. Behind the scenes, a very dark business was cooking and it exploded in season 1999/2000, the worst of our history. The last episode will be devoted to what happened that year on the pitch and outside of it.

==== [History time] How a whole generation of atléticos got PTSD (final part of the Gil saga). self.atletico ====
submitted 1 year ago by maeseCaracórner
Previously: how Jesús Gil became president, how he used his position to become owner of Atleti fraudulently and how the 90s seemed like a rollercoaster under his management. For this last episode, we will see how shit finally hit the fan (pun intended).
Inspired by Garate9 of colchonero.com and his brilliant saga. For this part I used other journalistic sources too (El Mundo, El País) and a lot of my own memory.
Chapter 4: Highway to Hell
For 1999/2000 we had great signings. Toni, Olympic champion GK. Gamarra, great CB. Hasselbaink, Premier League’s topscorer. On the bench Claudio Ranieri, Valencia’s rainmaker. Expectations were better than ever. Who would tell.
We beat Real Madrid for the last time in 15 years. The next time it happened r/atletico already existed.
Otherwise the team was already doing terrible (4th to last) when the news came and hit like thunder: as part of the judicial proceedings against Jesús Gil, the club was seized and put under judicial administration.
Why? Short answer: because the club itself was instrumental in many of his dirty maneuvers.
Remember Marbella from chapter 1? The posh holiday city where Gil won the election as mayor? It is known as the “ground zero” of the Spanish real estate bubble. Gil wanted to expand his business and promoted candidates in other coastal cities in the area, many of which won the 1999 local election (including the autonomous city of Ceuta). The joke was starting to turn too serious and someone high up decided to open a thorough investigation. They found corruption was so widespread and prices were so artificially inflated it ended up as the center of the biggest corruption scandal known to date.
As it turned out, one of the ways Jesús Gil was laundering the money from his corrupt business was by making it look as legal payments to a company of his property: Atlético de Madrid. The town of Marbella paid a huge amount to sponsor Atleti, but it was just a diversion to take the money out of the public treasury into Gil’s private estate. You can only imagine the public prosecutor displaying in court our glorious red&white shirt as “Exhibit A” of his case.
Wasn't this to benefit Atleti? Not really. At the same time Gil was diverting money out of Atleti into his own pocket. The most picturesque way was by signing unknown African “rising stars” on his expense and reselling them to Atleti for a huge profit. Actually, they were just random people, some of them refugees who were seeking asylum in Europe, and never got to play a single minute for the team. If you think this is too absurd to be true, think again: I’m just quoting the Supreme Court judgment of 2004 I mentioned in part 2 of this series.
Another sketchy business was that of the overprice for signings. Apparently, Atleti was paying above-market sums for players through opaque Dutch companies (that’s why Radek Bejbl or Bogdanovic cost almost as much as Ronaldo to Barcelona). The explanation was that it was a forward payment for free players. These companies would break the rule that forbids negotiating a contract directly with a player until 6 months before his engagement with his current team is over. Most payments were stopped by the judicial administrators, so we’ll never know how stinky was this. Best case scenario, just circumventing FIFA rules. Worst case who knows.
On 3 April 2000, judicial administrator Luis Manuel Rubí, after auditing the accounts, declared that the club was “technically bankrupt”. That month’s salaries were paid thanks to a favorable FIFA decision regarding a payment owed by Glasgow Rangers for the signing of Romanian defender Daniel Prodan.
When the final judgment about the Marbella sponsorship was delivered in 2002, Gil was found guilty but Atlético was declared not liable for the monetary debt. Thank God because that would have ended the team forever.
So, this was the situation. For most of the year the club was run by judicial administrators who only cared for auditing and finding evidence against Gil. Players and staff didn’t know if they were going to be paid. Rumor was the club was bankrupt, and it was finally confirmed. Many feared it would be relegated to amateur category or disappear altogether.
In this atmosphere we kept losing and losing. The league started really bad anyway, but the judicial administration only made things worse. 3 weeks to go and we needed to win every single match, and have Oviedo or Numancia lose every match, just to avoid relegation. We tied against Oviedo, with a missed penalty by Hasselbaink, and the fate was sealed.
And here comes what I consider an absolutely life-defining moment. Older atléticos around please confirm if you see it like that too. Somehow in the middle of this craze we made it to the Copa del Rey final against the relatively accessible Espanyol. We were already relegated when we played it.
That was it! We are Atleti, capable of the best and the worst! If someone is going to be relegated and be champions at the same time; play in second division and in Europe at the same time, that has to be us!! And it’s not like we’re facing Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia or Deportivo, it’s Espanyol. We really can do this!
Well, not only we lost. We lost to this (TW: Tamudo). On top of that, Toni, our GK, was a former Espanyol teammate.
It was sadistic. Can’t the Gods just relegate us the normal way? Do we have to be special even for this?
After this horror show, the number of season ticket holders almost doubled, but we didn’t get the promotion on the first year on mere goal difference. Destiny tricking us again. On the second year Luis Aragonés renounced to play the Champions League spot he had earned for Mallorca and came back home to put his beloved team back in its place. We didn’t have to celebrate our centennial in Segunda. Gil died and the Supreme Court declared the expiration of the fraudulent appropriation of the club (see part 2), so the property of Atleti will remain with his heirs until they decide to sell it. Several gray years, and we got to this, this, this, this, this, this this, this and this. Also this, which is the most proud I’ve ever felt.
This is who we are. Not everyone is brave enough to be one of us, and that's OK. If we wanted comfort, we would have chosen another team.

Our report from week commencing 20th December 1999:

The big news of the week was the sentence by judge García Castellón removing Atlético de Madrid president Jesus Gil and his entire board, and putting an embargo on the club's assets. The sentence makes strong reading. Gil is accused of several things, including illegally taking a majority share in the club, awarding himself and partner Enrique Cerezo 94.5% of the share capital without paying in any capital when the club was incorporated under the sporting companies act. Accounts were apparently falsified to show the club was solvent, which allowed them to remain in the first division, and also take advantage of government subsidies and tax relief, which ended up in the hands of management rather than the club. As a result of the club illegally staying in the top category (insolvent clubs should be relegated) they are also accused of negatively affecting several other clubs who were wrongly relegated or missed out on European competitions (32 clubs are named). Perhaps the most damning accusation however is that four players whose rights were owned by Gil's private company Promociones Futbolisticas, S.A. were transferred to Atlético de Madrid at exorbitant prices to pay off a debt which Gil had run up with the club of 2,700 million Pesetas. One of these, for example, Angolan refugee Bernado Djana is described as a construction worker who was transferred for 2 million Dollars. Another youngster, Maximillian Oliveira, was transferred for 1,100 million Pesetas when his rights already belonged to the club. In all the judge has accused Gil and his associates of expropriating 8,600 million Pesetas from the club. Luis Manuel Rubí Blanc has been named as legal administrator by the judge, and he will take over as president of the club. Jesus Gil denies any wrong doing, and has asked for his arguments to be heard, claiming that the whole thing is being orchestrated by his political enemies. We await his explanation.
=== What curse? How Atlético Madrid became world champions ===
Although it became the go-to excuse for various failures over the years, Atlético Madrid are not cursed, nor have they ever been. In a way, Los Rojiblancos are actually one of the luckiest teams in history, not least when they were granted the opportunity to become world champions without ever having been crowned champions of their own continent.

The idea of the club being ‘El Pupas’, essentially meaning ‘The Cursed Ones’, was coined by their great president Vicente Calderón on the night of the club’s 1974 European Cup final defeat to Bayern Munich, but it was a rare misguided comment from the man who would preside over the club for over two decades.

Convincing victories over Galatasaray, Dinamo Bucharest, Red Star Belgrade and a hotly contested win over Celtic had booked the Spanish side a ticket to final, held in Brussels at Heysel Stadium – as the ground was still named at the time – but it would not be a happy trip north. Neither side had ever lifted the trophy before, but their German opponents were a force to be reckoned as their squad was packed with talented players, many of whom – such as Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller – would go on to win the World Cup two months later.

The two teams could not be separated in 90 minutes, so the continent’s showpiece event entered extra-time, where Atlético took a late lead in the 114th minute via a beautiful curled free-kick from their star man Luis Aragonés.

It seemed the Madrid side had one hand on the trophy, but goalkeeper Miguel Reina, so the story goes, had neither hand in his goalkeeping gloves, which he was reportedly offering to the MARCA photographer behind his goal as a memento. It has never been proven, nor has it been disproven, that Reina celebrated in this premature fashion, but what is true is that defender Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck swung a desperate shot from around 40 metres out in the final seconds of extra-time, which bobbled into the goal.

As this was back in the days before penalty shoot-outs, Reina did not have the chance to immediately redeem himself and the two sides instead met for a replay – the only time the European Cup final was decided by such means – 48 hours later, in which the Germans strode to a 4-0 win past a demoralised Atlético side. Just as they mentally and physically collapsed like a rusty ironing board in extra-time of the 2014 final after Sergio Ramos’s 93rd-minute equaliser, Atleti were in no frame of mind to win that rematch, allowing Bayern to lift the first of their five European Cups.

It was in the aftermath of that final that Vicente Calderón uttered the phrase he would so quickly come to regret. “We are the Pupas,” he said, blaming the heartbreak on a dubious sense of impossibility, rather than on, for example, an inattentive goalkeeper.

He said it in the heat of the moment, not properly considering the defeatist mentality the phrase would go on to foster in the minds of some (but, of course, not all) Atlético fans and the narrative it would permit to some (again, not all) journalists over the coming decades. The club developed an exaggerated sense of its misfortune, which became difficult to shake off.

Yet Calderón was wrong. Atlético were a lucky bunch, as they would find out in just a few months’ time.

 



 

The 1974 World Cup seemed to have taken its toll on Bayern Munich’s star players, with the Bavarian giants and European champions stumbling out of the blocks at the start of their 1974-75 campaign. A 6-0 annihilation at the hands of Kickers Offenbach on the opening day was a shock wake-up call for the club. Although they secured victories in their next three league matches, that was then followed up by a run of three straight defeats.

As this was back in the day where only the champions of each league were permitted a berth in the following season’s European Cup, something had to be done if Bayern were to keep hold of their place at the top table of European football.

The club’s president, Wilhelm Neudecker, started to make noises to the press about the possibility of turning down their place, as champions of Europe, in that year’s Intercontinental Cup against whoever would win the next Copa Libertadores.

By the end of October, the news came through that Argentine side Independiente had won the competition for the third year in a row. With a reputation for ugly and violent football, there was even less incentive for Bayern to travel half-way across the world to have lumps kicked out of their already-fatigued World Cup-winning stars, so the club moved forward with the process of rejecting their place in the tie that, at the time, was a means of determining the best team on the planet.

Ajax, who had faced Independiente in the 1972 edition of the Intercontinental Cup, had been so put off by the death threats sent to Johan Cruyff from locals and by their opponents’ violent approach – which had required the unmber 7 to be substituted following a brutal challenge – that they declined to participate when they defended their European title and earned the right to contest the 1973 edition, thus setting a precedent for Bayern’s pull-out from the following year’s scheduled meeting with the Buenos Aires side.

Independiente were the ultimate pantomime villains; only a pursuit of 101 dalmatians or the locking up of Cinderella could have increased their perceived villainy in the eyes of the European elite.

So finally, with the Germans offering up the excuse of fixture congestion, in February 1975 Atlético Madrid were named as Europe’s representatives for the clash with the South American champions. Cursed? Immensely fortunate, rather. Atlético had won the golden ticket without even having even bought the Triple Dazzle Caramel Wonka bar required to enter.

 



 

Atlético had, just like Bayern, suffered a rocky start to the 1974-75 season. With just two wins from their first nine league matches, Calderón sent Juan Carlos ‘Toto’ Lorenzo – the man who had taken the club to the European Cup final – packing and took the odd decision of appointing the team’s top striker Aragonés as coach.

One day he was the team’s striker and the next he was retired, instead taking his place on the touchline. “Well, as you can see I am the new coach, so you now have me in charge. I hope we can win titles,” he told the players upon his promotion, using the formal ‘usted’ after years of addressing many of the same players with the informal ‘tú’.

In terms of winning titles, there were only really two available to Aragonés, with the club already knocked out of that season’s European competition and with Real Madrid already seven points ahead of them in the league – which, as this was back in the two-points-for-a-win days, was more than what we’d consider a seven-point margin today. As such, he had the domestic Copa del Generalísimo and the Copa Intercontinental as his two targets. His side would reach the final of the former, but it was the latter in which they’d achieve immortality.

“A win in this two-legged tie would save the season, for Atlético and for Luis Aragonés, who hadn’t yet been able to give the team the encouragement he’d hoped for,” journalist Chema Valdivieso Bonelli explained in an issue of Panenka Magazine, after having been fed the line straight from the mouth of Aragonés himself.

MAGAZINE ZANETTI

The tie was not played until early 1975, by which point Aragonés had had several months to convert Atlético Madrid into his own image, although he had witnessed mix results. The positive, though, was that they had a clear style of playing, one which was not too dissimilar to that which had served them so well the previous year, but one which had a few tweaks to it.

As journalist José Hernández put it, Atletico were “the most South American” of all the top European teams, so they stood a chance. Although it is a misconception to believe that Atlético have always played the aggressive style of football peddled by Diego Simeone, it is certainly true that in the mid-1970s the capital city side were more than capable of giving as good as they got from the notorious Independiente players.

Atlético also had an ace up their sleeve, as they had a man on the ground who knew all there was to know about their exotic opponents. Jorge Griffa, who had played for Atlético at centre-back for a decade between 1959 and 1969, had since retired and had moved back home to his native Argentina. Yet he wanted to help out his old team, a team he hoped, at the time, to come work for as a youth coach – and a team who should perhaps have taken up his offer given that he would help develop the likes of Jorge Valdano, Gabriel Batistuta, Mauricio Pochettino, Maxi Rodríguez, Gabriel Heinze, Éver Banega and Carlos Tevez back in Argentina.

Griffa delivered a brief yet informative scouting report to the advance party – consisting of two journalists, a kit man, a cook and the technical secretary Víctor Martínez – of his former and what-he-hoped-would-be-his-future employers, explaining what they could expect from the Independiente team.

“[José Alberto] Pérez, the goalkeeper, is notable,” the then-39-year-old explained. “He won’t do the impossible, but nor will he leave you stranded. The midfielders are strong, but their real strength is up front with [Agustín Alberto] Balbuena’s surprise runs, with [Ricardo Daniel] Bertoni’s great skill and with the talent of [Ricardo Enrique] Bochini. Bochini is super, but he doesn’t like tight man-marking, the way you do it in Spain, so if you keep him close he’ll suffer. Lastly, you’ll find that the best player is the captain [Ricardo] Pavoni, a left-back who never makes a mistake.”

The predictions soon proved to be well-founded. In front of a sold-out Estadio de la Doble Visera – which took in a record income of 200 million pesos that night, even with the game broadcast live on national television – the home side eked out a 1-0 win, with Pavoni starring as the man of the match, just as had been written in Griffa’s script.

Atleti midfielder Eusebio Bejarano did an excellent job of marking the scandalously gifted Bochini out of the game, which initially stifled the home side’s attacking options, but Bertoni was able to sashay past a few defenders before finding the incoming Balbuena for the goal 10 minutes before half-time – exactly the doomsday scenario Griffa had warned about.

The Spaniards had set up in a defensive-minded 4-4-2 formation, with only José Eulogio Gárate and Rubén Ayala venturing far into the Independiente half, suggesting that the aim was simply to take a small enough deficit back to the Spanish capital for the second leg, to be held just under one month later. If that was indeed their goal then they achieved it.

All Aragonés’ Atlético Madrid side had to do to become world champions was to don the metaphorical hard hat, put in a blue-collar shift and find a way to bash out a two-goal second leg win. A one-goal margin of victory would have forced extra-time, although there had been discussions over whether or not to contest a replay in the event of a draw.

The Independiente directors had requested their opponents pay eight million pesetas – around £40,000 – to hold a potential replay in Madrid instead of playing extra-time, but the Argentines withdrew that offer after winning the first match 1-0, causing some agitation between the two sets of directors.

Luis Aragonés (second from left) went on to become one of Atlético’s most revered figures



Yet, with just five minutes of the second leg to go, Argentine Rubén Ayala ruled out the need for replays or for extra-time by scoring the world championship-winning goal against his fellow countrymen.

Pleased with the showing from the first leg, Aragonés had made just one change from the line-up in Argentina for the second leg, bringing in Francisco Aguilar for Domingo Benegas in the back line. The game started just as it had done Buenos Aires, with a cagey first half hour. The only difference on this occasion was that it was Atlético who netted in the 34th minute, not Independiente.

Garate’s cross was met by Javier Irureta, who headed home to send the 65,000 fans packed into the stadium wild with delight. Garate, Ayala, Irureta and the new addition to the starting lineup, Aguilar, all had chances to score the second goal as Los Colchoneros created the better opportunities in the remainder of the match, but with their respective chances hitting everything but the back of the net, the fear of losing began to creep up from the River Manzanares and descend over the terraces.

Atleti’s hopes of glory had been burst in the dying seconds against Bayern just 11 months previously and Independiente, no matter how unlikely they looked like scoring, were one shot away from bursting the Madrid side’s bubble once again.

Yet Lady Luck decided to smile down on southern Madrid that Thursday evening. After bouncing around the penalty area like a pinball, the football fell to Ayala, who was in the right place – the edge of the penalty area – at the right time. He chested the ball forward, ran onto it, and wrote a piece of history with one swing of his left boot.

Just a few minutes later, Garate was lifting the Coupe Européenne-Sudamericaine as the captain of the first – and only – club to win the trophy without winning its continental prize first. Panathinaikos, Juventus, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Malmö and AC Milan had all contested it as European runners-up, but none of them had bested their South American opposition. Los Colchoneros had certainly done well to fight off a worthy and respected rival but they shouldn’t really have been lining up against Balbuena, Bertoni, Bochini and co. in the first place.

Many Atlético fans, however, continued to believe their club was cursed – and some still do to this day. But how can a club that was afforded the chance to become world champion without ever becoming European champion be cursed?

How can a club that finished second bottom in 1936, only to be spared relegation because of the Spanish Civil War and then win the first title after the resumption of the league, be cursed?

How can a club that has won nine of its 10 Spanish cups in their rivals Real Madrid’s back yard, even defeating said neighbours in four of those finals, be cursed?

How can a club that has won half of their 10 league titles on the final day thanks to their rivals failing to win be cursed?

How can a club that has averaged one trophy per season over the past five years, despite a massive financial disadvantage compared to its domestic and continental rivals, be cursed?

If you hear something enough times it’s easy to start believing it, especially in football, a business which loves a mantra more than most. For many, to hear that Atlético were cursed even just once was all it took to be considered fact. Yet within a year from Vicente Calderón uttering that phrase in the heat of the moment following his European Cup heartbreak, his beloved Atleti would be world champions. Cursed? What curse?
=== Stadium Metropolitano de Madrid ===
==== Key facts ====

Club: Club Atlético de Madrid | Opening: 1923 | Closing: 1966 | Final capacity: 58,000

==== Description ====

Stadium Metropolitano was for over 40 years the home of Club Atlético de Madrid until the club moved in 1966 to Estadio Vicente Calderón.

In its first decade of existence Atlético had played at various makeshift grounds until the club moved in 1913 to Campo de O'Donnell, not to be confused with the stadium with the same name that Real Madrid occupied at that time.

However, Atlético's ambitions soon outgrew Campo de O'Donnell and a piece of land was bought in the north of the city near the Avenida de la Reina Victoria. The plot was strategically chosen as it lay not far from the newly opened metro station Cuatro Caminos on Madrid's first metro line, though the club would also build an additional electric tramway to connect the metro station with the stadium.

The site of the proposed stadium already had the natural shape of an amphitheatre and therefore only one proper stand had to get built to complement the earth banks which served as terraces.

Stadium Metropolitano officially opened on the 13th of May 1923 and an estimated 20,000 people witnessed Atlético beating Real Sociedad 2-1.

The capacity of the stadium was initially about 25,000, though another 20,000 could witness the games for free from elevated places outside the stadium. The architect had been José María Castell, who would go on to design Real Madrid's Campo de Chamartín, which would open one year later not far from the Stadium Metropolitano.

In 1929 the stadium was the site of the England national team's first loss outside of the British Islands. Spain sent the English home with a 4-3 defeat.

In the late 1930s the stadium got severely damaged during the Spanish Civil War. For a few years Atlético was forced to play its home matches at other grounds, but then made use of the opportunity to thoroughly rebuilt the Metropolitano, which included the construction of proper terraces at the ends where before were mere earth banks.

Stadium Metropolitano reopened on the 21st of February 1943 with a match against Real Madrid (2-1). The renovated stadium counted with a capacity of 35,800, which soon however turned out to be too small again. In the early 1950s the pitch was therefore dug out and an additional lower tier was added, which raised capacity to about 58,000 places.

However, by that time the stadium had already significantly aged and more modern stadiums were built elsewhere in Spain, not the least Real's Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. It therefore did not take long for Atlético to start making plans too, and in the early 1960s a plot of land was bought on the southern edge of the city on the banks of the Rio Manzaneras.

While Atlético's proposed new stadium was technically closer to Madrid's city centre than the Metropolitano, the city had until then mostly grew northwards and many Atlético fans protested against moving to the edge of the city. The current protests of moving to Estadio La Peineta may therefore for the older fans seem like a deja vu.

Estadio Vicente Calderón finally opened in October 1966 and the abandoned Stadium Metropolitano got soon after demolished and replaced by residential buildings.

=== Madrid – Estadio Metropolitano ===
by Chris Clements | Posted on Tuesday, April 10th, 2012

How can I say this politely? Well, it's like this… Atlético Madrid has played around a bit. There you go, I've said it. You see, between its formation in 1903 and moving to their present home in October 1966, Atléti changed venues on ten occasions. Sometimes they played in the the east of Madrid, sometimes to the west, and occasionally they were Real Madrid's tenants, but throughout this period, the club's one true home was the Estadio Metropolitano.

(An early 20th century Sporting Metropolis – the Calle O'Donnell)

Founded on 26 April 1903 by a group of Basque students at the Colegio de Ingenieros de Minas, Athletic Club de Madrid was an affiliated body of their parent club, Athletic Club de Bilbao. This arrangement continued until 1912, when it became a club in its own right. Early matches were played to the east of Madrid at a very basic ground called the Campo del Retiro. In 1913, the club moved to a location in central Madrid on the Calle de O'Donnell. This enclosure is often confused with that of Real Madrid's, who had opened their own ground a month earlier, which was fifty metres to the north east. Athletic's first match at the Calle O'Donnell was on 9 February 1913,  when the club lost to Athletic Club de Bilbao 0-4 in front of a crowd of 10,000. Here the club remained until May 1923, when it moved to the north west of Madrid and the Metropolitano.

(Nearing completion, the Estadio Metropolitano in early 1923)

The Estadio Metropolitano was built by the Urbanizadora Metropolitana, the forerunners of today's Madrid Metro as part of a real estate development close to the city's University. Architect José María Castell used the site of a natural amphitheatre, and at a cost of 1.5 million pesetas developed what would be largest and best stadium in the Spanish capital. The southern side featured an open area of seating that was accessed from the rear at street level. The eastern end behind the goal had a semi-circular terrace, which was also accessed at its rear. The northern side was made up of wooden bleachers, but was relatively slim as the land fell away quite sharply to the north west. The west end was left open, but further standing was provided on a cinder athletics track, which ran around the club's first grass pitch. Officially, the stadium had a capacity of 25,000, but accounts of the stadium's size vary greatly, in part to the additional standing provided on the athletics track, but also the large open grass banks the stood on either side and above the east terrace. This meant that crowds of 45,000 were not uncommon, and there are contemporary reports of as many as 75,000 attending fixtures.

(Pride of 1920's Madrid  – Estadio Metropolitano)

The stadium was inaugurated on 13 May 1923, when a crowd of 25,000 saw Athletic beat Real Sociedad by two goals to one. Whilst the home supporters were happy with the result, they and the local press were less than happy with the new stadium. Transport to the stadium was poor and when you arrived, access into the arena was congested. The Spanish Football Federation was also unhappy at the high cost of admission into the stadium, and whilst Athletic's matches continued to attract decent crowds, the stadium's other tenants, Racing Club de Madrid and Gimnastica Española struggled to attract an audience. Athletic and the Urbanizadora Metropolitana made a commitment to improve transport, access and facilities and by 1925 the stadium had a capacity of 30,000 and improved services. Four years later on 15 May 1929, 45,000 paid to watch the Spanish National Team inflict the first defeat on England by a continental side. The 4-3 victory was masterminded by the Spanish national coach, Fred Pentland, who happened to be English. Oh, the irony! Later that year, Athletic could not agree new terms with the owners and in September 1929 the club left the Metropolitano.

(Campo de Vallecas – Dodgy pitch even by 1930's standards)

Athletic started the 1929-30 season at Real Madrid's Charmatin stadium, and also played some home fixtures back in their old stamping ground of the Campo de Vallecas. They eventually returned to the Metropolitano in January of 1930, but the upheaval clearly did not help, and Athletic finished bottom of La Primera and was relegated. During the summer of 1930, the Urbanizadora Metropolitana carried out another upgrade to the stadium, building a covers over the southern and northern sides of the ground, but also converting the athletics track to allow greyhound racing. This didn't curry any favours with the Spanish Federation, who apparently outlawed the use of the stadium. So, Athletic returned to the east of Madrid and the Campo de Vallecas. The pitch at Vallecas was poor and over the next few seasons, the poor surface and disputes with the owners of the Metropolitano, saw the club criss-cross the capital, even playing matches back at Real Madrid's Chamartin. Athletic won promotion back to La Primera at the end of the 1933-34 season and played home matches during the 34-35 season at the Campo de Vallecas. The following season saw the club return to the Metropolitano, but this didn't inspire Athletic and a measly return of 15 points saw the club finish eleventh. However, relegation to La Segunda was the last thing on the club's mind when war broke out on the 17 July 1936.

(1939 & a decimated landscape with the Metropolitano at the centre)

The Civil War hit Athletic hard. Only six playing staff returned after the hostilities and the club had debts of over 1 million pesetas. To add to their woes, both the Campo de Vallecas and the Metropolitano had been destroyed. Drastic times call for drastic measures and in October 1939 the club merged with the air-force backed Aviación Nacional, to form Athletic-Aviación Club. Oviedo's inability to compete in the 39-40 La Primera threw the club a lifeline, and the Federation arranged a play-off between Athletic-Aviación and Osasuna for a place in that season's first division. Athletic-Aviación won the tie 3-1 and started the 39-40 season back at Real Madrid's Estadio Chamartin. Under the stewardship of the great Ricardo Zamora, Athletic-Aviación were a revelation and as the season progressed, both they and Sevilla battled for the league title. It came down to the final set of matches, with Athletic-Aviación's 2-0 win over Valencia at the renovated Campo de Vallecas earning them a first ever league title. The club retained its league title in 40-41 and during the summer, was forced to change to the Spanish version of their name, becoming Atlético–Aviación. During this period, work was under way on rebuilding the damaged Metropolitano. This included a new main stand, new terracing at the east end and for the first time, a substantial terrace on the north side of the ground. The Metropolitano was re-inaugurated on 21 February 1943 with a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid. Atlético were Madrid's top side throughout the 1940's and here's some footage of their 5-0 derby win from November 1947.

(Atlético dug deep and extended the stadium in 1954)

On the back of two further back to back title wins, Atlético finally purchased the Metropolitano on 15 April 1950 and immediately set about improving the facilities. The architect for the work was club president and former player, Javier Barroso. The first phase saw the terracing extended around to the west end and new changing facilities were built beneath this terrace. Then in the summer of 1954, the club took the audacious decision to excavate the pitch and add another ring of seating where the greyhound/athletics track had stood. This increased the official capacity to 58,000, but just when thoughts were turning to another period of success, their rivals from across the city upped the ante, winning nine of the next twelve league titles. Despite its recent refurbishment, the Estadio Metropolitano was already out of date, dwarfed by the newer, larger stadiums that Real Madrid and Barcelona had built. Thoughts were already turning to building a new stadium, when Atlético finally won the Copa in 1960 and made up for lost time with another success a year later. 

(Nearing the end. The Metropolitano in the mid-1960's)

In 1961, Atlético purchased large plot of land in the south western outskirts of Madrid, next to a gas works and on the banks of the Rio Manzanares. Work was slow, and with the Metropolitano sold and the club suffering financially, they moved in with Real Madrid for part of the 1964-65 season. They brokered an agreement to return to the Metropolitano for one final season in 1965-66 and gave the stadium a glorious send-off by winning La Primera. Here is some footage of the stadium in May 1965, when Atlético beat Real Madrid 4-0 in the last 16 of the Copa. Atléti played its last game at the old stadium on 8 May 1966, when they beat Athletic Club 1-0 in the first leg of the quarter final of the Copa del Generalisimo. The move south to their new stadium was  delayed until week 4 of the 1966-67 season, which given the upheavals of the previous 43 years, was not unexpected.

=== Bangor City celebrate 30th anniversary of Atletico Madrid tie ===
15:02, 5 NOV 2015 UPDATED 15:12, 5 NOV 2015
BY DAVE JONES

Citizens did Wales proud at the Vicente Calderon
    
Bangor City's European Cup Winners' Cup 1985/86 squad

THIRTY years ago tomorrow one of the most famous matches in Bangor City's long and proud history took place.

November 6, 1985, was the date and the Vicente Calderon stadium the venue for the European Cup Winners' Cup second round, second leg clash between Spanish giants Atletico Madrid and Bangor of the Northern Premier League.

It was David versus Goliath in every sense.

Atletico, runners-up in La Liga and winners of the Copa del Rey the previous season against City, 10th in the NPL in 1984/85 and qualifiers for the ECWC by virtue of being beaten finalists in the Welsh Cup to Shrewsbury Town, who being an English club were not eligible.

Bangor had already made history when they defeated Fredrikstad of Norway on away goals in the previous round.

This made the Citizens the only British non-league club to progress past the first round of a European competition, although Borough United, a merger of Llandudno Junction and Conwy Borough, did beat Sliema Wanderers of Malta in the Cup Winners' Cup preliminary round in 1963/64.

Few gave City a prayer against the mighty Atletico, who had knocked out Glasgow Celtic in the opening round, yet in the first leg at Farrar Road, a crowd of over 5,000 saw the hosts put up a cracking display in a 2-0 defeat.

The Spaniards broke the deadlock in the fifth minute when Jorge Orosman da Silva, capped 26 times by Uruguay, finished from close range after keeper Dai Davies kept out an initial shot.

In the 25th minute Quique Setien, a Spanish international, was allowed to work the ball onto his left foot and drill home from about 20 yards.

City competed on an even keel for the rest of the game and went close to scoring on a couple of occasions.

The return leg at the Estadio Vicente Calderon was astonishing as a near full-strength Atletico scraped a narrow 1-0 win secured by Jesus Landaburu's thunderous 27th-minute free kick.

The match will always be remembered for a tremendous 38th-minute penalty save from ex-Wales and Everton goalkeeper Davies from Da Silva and also the ovation the visitors received from a warm Madrid crowd at the final whistle.

Current City boss Powell took on the might of Atletico Madrid
Included in the Bangor side for both legs was one Neville Powell, now manager of the Citizens.

Powell made 86 first-team appearances for Tranmere Rovers before joining City in 1984.

He played at Farrar Road for eight years, appearing for the club in the first League of Wales season of 1992/93.

After 14 years at the helm with Connah's Quay Nomads, Powell took over as Bangor boss in 2007 and has gone on to win three Welsh Cups and the Welsh Premier League title in 2010/11 with the club.

Powell still has vivid memories of that game at the Vicente Calderon.

"It certainly doesn't seem like 30 years ago, it seems more like yesterday," he said.

"The atmosphere inside the stadium was fantastic. We brought about 200 to 300 Bangor fans over with us and with them knowing they were going to win the tie, the Spaniards gave us a great ovation. In the end they were on our side.

"The media focus was intense as due to the Heysel ban we were the only British side left in Europe.

"I remember Hugh Johns (late TV football commentator) being there as we were the main match on midweek football that night.

"Atletico Madrid were the Manchester United of the time in Spain. We'd watched a video of them beating Celtic the night before and it was scary stuff!

"But we'd given them a good game at Farrar Road. We went 2-0 down early on, but had them on the rack at times in the second half.

"Still, we were expected to lose heavily in Spain. They were a skillful side, full of Brazilian and Uruguayan internationals, but we competed really well with them.

"Dai Davies's penalty save was something else; we had a really good side then - Mark Palios, Gerry Banks, Les Armor - some really good players.

"It was a night I'll never forget. The Spaniards really looked after us and gave each of us a commemorative sword with the name Atletico Madrid on it.

"You'd never get one through customs nowadays; I've still got mine.

"I was proud to play for Bangor City back then and I am equally proud to manage the club now."

=== Inside Atlético Madrid: can the club go global? ===

Real Madrid's less glamorous neighbours are competing with Europe's elite and have plans to go global

Just before Atlético Madrid's team bus arrives at the stadium for a match, the driver always puts on the same song: “Thunderstruck”, by the Australian hard-rock band AC/DC. The players blare out the lyrics: “Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder/ I was caught/ In the middle of a railroad track.”

The words sum up Atlético's self-image. Thunderous passion, or so Atléti's fans say, allows this unglamorous neighbourhood club to compete with the world's best. Fernando Torres, Atlético fan turned Atlético player, told me: “You have to be more concentrated every game, every minute, because you are not the same quality as the others, because you cannot have 23 players paid over €4m. It's not easy but you can win this way.”

Indeed, last year Atléti reached the Champions League final, pinnacle of European club football, against their neighbours Real Madrid. But now Madrid's second club hope to establish themselves at football's summit based on more than just thunder. Atlético are on a quest to tap the world's resources while remaining unmistakably Atlético. A homely club are going global.

Founded in 1903, Atlético play in the Calderón stadium by the Manzanares river just outside central Madrid — the scruffier end of a scruffy city. When the fans gather near the Calderón before kick-off, it could be an English crowd circa 1990: beer-drinking on the streets, exploding fireworks and illegally parked cars. Even the VIP entrance is in a motorway tunnel. Atlético define themselves through contrast with impossibly glamorous Real Madrid, and this urban ugliness contributes to what marketing executives would call the club's brand, or what Atléti fans call its “soul”.

Atlético's modern history begins with the fat, loud-mouthed property developer Jesús Gil. He first gained national fame in 1969, when one of his buildings collapsed in Segovia, killing 58 people. (He hadn't bothered to employ surveyors or architects or to draw up plans.) He spent 18 months in jail before General Franco pardoned him.

In 1987 Gil became president of Atlético. From then until his burial in 2004, in a coffin wrapped in an Atlético flag, he often loomed larger than the club. Gil would pontificate on TV about conspiracies against Atléti while perched in a Jacuzzi amid bikini-clad women. He specialised in racism, homophobia and sacking managers. After many legal scrapes in more than a decade as mayor of Marbella, in 2002 he was banned from holding public office for 28 years. He and Atlético vice-president Enrique Cerezo were also found guilty of having misappropriated their 236,056 shares in the club. However, the Supreme Court subsequently acquitted them. The statute of limitations passed, and they were allowed to keep the shares.

Today Atlético's chief executive is Gil's son, Miguel Angel Gil Marín. Quiet, polite and wearing a neat suit, he appears the total opposite of his dad.

The son occupies a little office at the Calderón, a few doors down from his father's old giant office, which he prefers not to use. (It's now the club's trophy room, overlooked, inevitably, by a porcine portrait of Gil Sr) Miguel and his family own 57 per cent of Atlético's shares but he has said that almost none of that holding derives from Jesús's shares.

After training as a vet, Miguel began working for Atlético in the early 1990s. He lists some things he learnt: “To know the locker room is the most important thing about a football club. And to know how people feel football: with passion and irrationality.”

When I ask about his dad, he tries to distract me with a McKinsey report about Atlético's future revenues. When I press, he says he loved his father. “But, as an employee, it's not easy to work for this kind of personality because often they don't listen. I think it might be like working for people like [Silvio] Berlusconi or [Roman] Abramovich.”

By the mid-1990s, Miguel was effectively running Atlético. Still, when they won the Spanish league and cup in 1996, it was Jesús who paraded through Madrid on an elephant. Four years later, while Jesús was suspended from football, Atléti were relegated to the second division. Few fans were put off. Because Real are associated with winning, Atléti take a certain pride in losing. The club's nickname, “El Pupas”, means roughly “The Jinxed”.

In 2001, Torres, then aged 17, made his debut for Atlético in the second division. His working-class madrileño grandfather had taken him to his first game six years before, spontaneously after a Sunday lunch. “When I was a kid I just wanted to play for Atlético Madrid,” Torres says. “One game in [the] first division is enough for me. Every game after that is a gift.”

No other great player has such mastery of fan-speak. However, Torres, now 31, can go beyond cliché. Like many older footballers, he has acquired the ability to reflect. When I point out that he left his beloved club for Liverpool in 2007, and that footballers don't think like fans, he agrees. “It's completely different,” he says. “As a player you feel the responsibility. You miss — it hurts, because you know it's your fault. The team you're supporting didn't win because you didn't do well. Every year, because you are a better player than when you start, the responsibility is bigger.

“You know, I gave seven years of my career to Atlético and I felt, most probably, some of my best years as a player. But I needed to do that. The decision to leave was the hardest decision of my life. The first, second and maybe third year away, I couldn't watch Atlético Madrid games. I felt so guilty.”

Even without Torres, Atléti continued to rise. That was partly Miguel Gil's doing. The chief executive gives Atlético a calm stability that's rare in Spanish football, where hysterical radio phone-ins continue well past midnight. “He's the longest-serving CEO/owner in Spain,” notes Peter Kenyon, former CEO of Manchester United and Chelsea, who now advises Atléti. “Miguel's had good times and bad times and good times and bad times, and the next 10 years we're going to have good times and bad times. There's a realism there.”

To keep himself realistic, Gil doesn't attend Atlético games. Here's something he learnt from seeing his father do it wrong: “Don't go to the locker room before and after the games, because when your heart is racing you're not good at decision-making.” Gil usually spends Atlético games strolling around the farm outside Madrid where his family raises bulls and horses. “I watch the game the day after on TV. It's the best way to check team performance, how each player played, the decisions of the coach, when your heart is quiet. If not I will do exactly the same as a fan — just watch the goals.”

Gil's main occupation is finding funds for Atlético. However, in economically stricken Spain, what corporate money there is usually goes to Real or Barcelona. For years, Atléti funded themselves with debt. By 2010, the club owed €452m, calculated José María Gay de Liébana, economist at the University of Barcelona. Nearly half of that was unpaid taxes. “Atlético decided to leverage with the Spanish tax authorities,” shrugs Gil.

The club also got into bed with agents. When “third-party ownership” (TPO) of footballers was legal, agents owned stakes in some Atléti players. If the player was sold, the agent shared in the profits. The name usually mentioned in this context is Portuguese “super-agent” Jorge Mendes, a former partner of Kenyon's.

Mendes certainly parked great players such as Sergio Agüero, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa at Atléti. Gil calls him “the best agent”. However, he adds: “I just did one deal with Jorge Mendes about TPO. He offers his players to every club, that's his job. I'm happy to be close to Jorge because he helps Atlético by offering good players and participating in the market when Atlético decide to sell some of them.” Gil says Atléti now have only about three players from Mendes's stable.

Today TPO is banned, and Spain's new financial regulations compel clubs to pay off their debts (something Atlético are doing fast). Those changes could have hurt Atléti. Instead the club is booming. Ask Atléti people why, and they usually mention their coach, Diego Simeone.

The Argentine first joined Atlético in 1994 as an ankle-biting midfielder, brimming with angry desire and gamesmanship. When David Beckham gently kicked him during England v Argentina at the World Cup in 1998, Simeone played dead, Beckham was sent off and England lost.

Gil got to know Simeone as a rare footballer who thought about the club rather than just about himself. “He often tried to talk with me about strategy, tactics, ideas, the relationship with another player. Today I have another one like that: Tiago [the former Chelsea midfielder]. I'm sure he will be one of the best coaches in the future.”

When Gil needed a new coach in 2011, he phoned the clubs Simeone had coached before, River Plate in Argentina and Catania in Italy. “The information was not good in both cases,” he says. Despite that, Gil took the risk and hired him. Even if Simeone failed, his Atléti past would please the fans.

Today the narrative is that Simeone made Atlético great. This story has holes in it. Football talk tends to exaggerate the role of the coach. He is the face of the club, the guy who explains at the postmatch press conference why his team won or lost, and so unearthly powers get wrongly ascribed to him. In Simeone's case, the effect is enhanced. During Atlético matches, your eyes are easily drawn to the tense upright figure on the touchline dressed head to toe in formal black, like a nightclub owner or the devil in a Frank Zappa song. Sometimes he waves his arms to rouse Atléti's fans to thunder. That might help a little. But the main explanation for the personality cult around Simeone is that he incarnates the club's values.

His nickname is “El Cholo” and Atléti's style is now often described as “cholismo”. This essentially means the whole team playing with Simeonesque aggression. The coach likes to say his players must be “hombres” (men). When I asked Atlético's young Belgian winger Yannick Ferreira Carrasco what exactly this meant, he explained: “People who have their balls in the right place.”

“Training is nonstop, nonstop,” says Carrasco. “You run from one exercise to another, so that your heart rate doesn't go down.” Atléti's French star Antoine Griezmann says that, as a result of Simeone's training sessions, “in the match you are ready for any kind of physical contact”.

Atlético's training ground is outside Madrid, a few minutes' drive from La Finca, the exclusive housing estate where Atlético and Real players live happily as neighbours. At the training ground, two cars parked side by side form a kind of exhibit of the footballer's life stages. Stage one (reflecting first salary): grey Ferrari. Stage two (once fatherhood comes, usually in a player's early twenties): black Range Rover.

On the training field, Atlético's players charge about as Carrasco had described, with Simeone wandering around shouting banalities: “Go! That's good! Let's play!” The words aren't the point. Rather, his menacing presence, proclaimed in that unmistakable Argentine accent, is a reminder to keep moving.

Cholismo — encouraged by Atlético's fans as much as by Simeone — helps the team compete with Real and Barcelona. Torres says: “If you are driving, I don't know, a Seat Ibiza and you are in the same race with a Ferrari and a Porsche, you have to do perfect to compete. Real Madrid and Barcelona have €300m, €400m more to spend every year. Better infrastructure, better training facilities” — he gestures around the poky hut at the training ground where we are talking — “better contracts for players. So how can you compete against them? You have to be more concentrated, every game.”

He describes what football is like for a superior team. “I've been in Liverpool, Chelsea. Sometimes you are not having a good game, the opposition is doing better, and in one second” — he snaps his fingers — “a player wins you the game. Madrid and Barcelona have this situation many times. We [Atlético] have to work every, every game, from the first minute until the end, with 100 per cent concentration, because if we lose this concentration, maybe we concede a goal, and it's more difficult for us to score two than for Madrid and Barcelona.”

In 2013-2014, cholismo produced Atlético's best season in 111 years. They won the Spanish league (the first breach of the Madrid-Barça duopoly in a decade), and then, in the Champions League final in Lisbon, entered injury time leading Real 1-0. Torres — miserable at Chelsea at the time — was watching the climactic moment of Atléti's history live on TV. Was that bittersweet?

“I never felt jealousy,” he replies. “I was so nervous. Like a fan. If Atlético win, my team is going to win the Champions League. What more can you ask? I just wanted so, so hard to win. And it was so difficult to handle when [Sergio] Ramos scored [Real's 92nd-minute equaliser].

“I left the room, I didn't even watch the extra time because I was expecting what was going to happen.” Real went on to win 4-1.“It was so painful, because it was so close. Football is beautiful because of these kinds of things.”

In January Torres rejoined Atléti, as an ageing substitute rather than the star he used to be. Soon after his return, he scored at home against Barcelona and knelt and kissed the Calderón turf. “It was spontaneous,” he says. “It's like a welcome kiss to the grass: ‘I'm here.' The club gave me everything. I learnt as a player, as a person. It's like I need to give them something back, something you can touch — a trophy.”

Torres believes Atlético are Spain's natural third-best team. They were before, and are again now. However, he isn't confident his club can enduringly match the best. “I know how difficult it should be for Atlético to reach the [Champions League] final. I don't know if we are going to be able to do it again.”

Gil is trying to ensure they can. His project resembles what many English clubs did in the 1990s: find foreign investors, build a swish new stadium, and generally boost revenues. No wonder he has sought advice from Peter Kenyon, who is synonymous with English football's commercialisation. Atlético's quest for funds is global. In January Wang Jianlin, China's richest man according to Forbes, chairman of the Dalian Wanda property group and a football fan, bought 20 per cent of Atlético for €45m. Azerbaijan's unlovely regime pays to put “Azerbaijan — Land of Fire” on the team shirts. And Atlético have joined with Indian investors to create Atlético de Kolkata, reigning champions of India.

One rainy afternoon in Madrid, a club official drove me out of town to visit Atlético's future stadium. It's now still a grey skeleton, on a boulevard of broken dreams: the site of Madrid's plannedOlympic Villagee. After three straight failed bids, the city finally canned its Olympic hopes. Instead, Atlético will move here in 2017. The stadium will have 70,000 seats (15,000 more than the Calderón) and will cost about €220m.

Building a big stadium is something many clubs do in a fit of hubris during good times. Madrid may not prove rich enough to fund two big clubs. However, Atlético can make a plausible case. The new stadium, unlike the Calderón, will have lots of parking; it will have restaurants and bars to stop fans spending their money at neighbourhood joints; and 7,500 lucrative corporate seats.

Gil is also looking forward to selling the Calderón. The first time I met him, in London, he immediately showed me a Spanish newspaper article that estimated the neighbourhood's land prices at €5,500 per square metre.

Still, moving house is wrenching. One day the ugly Calderón might be remembered as the club's true, lost home. Atlético's challenge, one official says, is to “transfer our soul” to the new stadium. “We will lose something,” another official admits, “but we will gain so much.”

Atléti will also gain from a revolutionary change in Spanish football: clubs have just agreed to divide their TV money more equally. “That's a game-changer,” says Kenyon. For years, every Spanish club negotiated its own TV deal. That suited Real and Barcelona, which in 2013/2014 each got €140m from broadcasters. However, smaller clubs got peanuts. Consequently, Real and Barça monopolised the best players. This inequality allowed a midsized country in economic crisis to fund two world-beating teams. But it also made the Spanish league boringly predictable. As one Atléti official phrases the question: “Do we want to have a league or just two clubs that we clap?” Finally, under pressure from government, Real and Barcelona consented to a new, more redistributive system.

Gil spells it out. Previously, the smallest clubs got one-twelfth the TV income of Real and Barça. Now the ratio is 1 to 4.5, and next year it will be 1 to 3.5. Atlético's TV income should jump from €41m last season to about €95m next year, he says.

In the golden season of 2013/2014, Atlético's total revenues were €169.9m, the 15th highest in European football, according to consultancy Deloitte. By 2020, McKinsey projects Atléti's revenues at €310m. Logically, even that shouldn't be enough to compete at the top. Real already have annual revenues of €661m, the highest of any club in any sport ever. But Real need more money than Atléti, because they are under more pressure from their fans. First, Real need to buy big-name players. Second, Real have to attack, which requires better players than winning with cholismo. And third, if Real want a player, his price soars. Last year Real bought goalkeeper Keylor Navas from Levante for €10m, double what Atléti had previously arranged to pay.

Moreover, Real and Barcelona are heading for personnel crises. Madrid's unrivalled star, Cristiano Ronaldo, is 30. Barça's star, Lionel Messi, is 28 and becoming injury-prone. There are no like-for-like replacements for them on this earth. When Ronaldo and Messi fade, Atlético could benefit.

One Sunday evening I went to watch Atléti play Valencia in the Calderón. In the first half, Atléti played their new, uncharacteristically attractive attacking game — cholismo 2.0 — and went 2-0 up. The home fans, many of them women and children, happily munched sunflower seeds. Atléti's hardcore “ultra” fans sang nonstop. Here was the new superclub. However, when Valencia scored after half time, anxiety spread through the stands. The fans remained positive. As Carrasco says: “They applaud the players. It takes many negative things for them to whistle.” But they looked increasingly unhappy and stressed. (It's said that Atlético's fans go home as exhausted as the players.) When the referee blew the final whistle, the old man sitting beside me exclaimed, “Que sufrimiento!” (what suffering!). But then that's always been the point of supporting Atlético.

=== Why debt-ridden Atletico Madrid should not be considered a team of the people ===
By Peter Staunton
30 Apr 2014 09:50:00

Vast levels of borrowing and a lack of transparency in the transfer market over the last 20 years make the Atleti story far less romantic than some would have us believe

There are a fair few fans across the continent willing Atletico Madrid to go even further in this season's Champions League as Diego Simeone's team prepare to take on Chelsea in the second leg of their semi-final on Wednesday night. Their evolution from Europa League winners to Champions League contenders under the Argentine coach has earned them a great deal of respect. 

Simeone has forged a committed and diligent unit capable of disrupting the very best teams in the world. That is the company in which they belong after taking four points from Real Madrid in La Liga - as well as beating them in last season's Copa del Rey final - and eliminating Barcelona from Europe this season. As things stand, they are favourites to win the Spanish top flight too. 

This, however, cannot be seen as a defiant victory for the little man in the face of the immense strength of the Clasico duo. While Simeone's on-field turnaround merits credit, Atletico are not deserving of their billing of people's champions. That would be to whitewash their recent history. The capital club have come to represent, in recent years, much which is troubling about the modern game: third-party ownership, spiralling debts and an abdication of responsibility.

Atletico are Spain's third-biggest team in terms of revenue and support but have struggled to keep their house in order since converting to a PLC in 1992. Ever since Jesus Gil became chief shareholder, Atletico's financial management has been open to question. 

This is a club that has shown disregard for the regulations and fiscal prudence throughout its modern history. They were relegated in 2000 not long after their offices were raided in the infamous Caso Atletico. That eventually led to Gil's jail sentence of three-and-a-half years as well as punishments for Enrique Cerezo and Miguel Angel Gil Marin - who remain at the club. Following relegation, they simply stopped paying their taxes for two years. In that way they avoided around €46 million (£37.7m) worth as they expedited their escape from the Segunda Division. 

Godfather of modern Atletico | Jesus Gil was majority shareholder and died in 2004

By 2011 they owed a scarcely conceivable €517 million (£424.3m) to creditors - including as much as €171m (£140.3m) to the tax authorities alone. The Spanish government could have done more to call in the debt instead of offering Atletico a favourable rate of 4.5 per cent interest per annum while they paid off €15m (£12.3m) of their tax bill every year. 

Perversely, the economic meltdown in Spain, where unemployment stands at around 26%, gave Atletico the opportunity to alleviate their own predicament. "The government cannot demand payment without crippling clubs and leaving supporters very upset," economics and finance professor Jose Maria Gay told Die Welt in 2012. "Considering the situation our country is facing, it is unreasonable to start introducing dysfunctional steps into the championship that could affect its image, which has a commercial value."

That rationale meant that laxity prevailed. Uli Hoeness, then president of Bayern Munich, expressed his frustration when referring to the EU bailout of Spain in 2012. "This is unthinkable," he said. "We pay hundreds of millions to get them out of the sh*t, and then the clubs don't pay their debts." 

Not paying their debts was Atletico's modus operandi under Gil. Although they have finally begun to pay down their tax debt, in theory, they will have not paid what they owe until some time early in the next decade. Instead of taking it on the chin and, perhaps, living within their means, Atletico simply carry on spending. Uefa temporarily withheld their Europa League prize money for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations in 2012. Atletico were among the first teams to be sanctioned although their punishment was eventually overturned. It is not difficult to see why they came on the radar. 

Not long after sending Sergio Kun Aguero on his way to Manchester City to stave off the tax man, a deal worth €40m (£32.8m) to bring in Radamel Falcao from Porto was agreed. It was apparent that Atletico were unable to fund the deal themselves and so the Doyen Sports Group - a hedge fund - reportedly picked up around 50% of the fee. 

Falcao may well have enjoyed his best years at Atletico but they never deserved to have him. They could not afford it from within their means. That didn't stop them. Falcao was not the only one. According to one investigation in 2013, it was found that only six players on their first-team books were owned outright by the club. Despite the circumstances in which they found themselves, Atleti still spent over €160m (£131.3m) net on transfer fees from 2002 to 2009. To chase deals for the best players in the world while owing so much in back payments smacks of astonishing hubris. 

Even being assisted by Doyen in paying for Falcao, Atletico could still not maintain their obligations to Porto. The Portuguese club, according to reports, were close to asking Fifa for a resolution when Los Rojiblancos fell behind in their instalments. Shortly after that complaint, Doyen's name began appearing on the Atleti kit. 

And on the subject of kit sponsors, Atletico are currently into their second agreement with the Azerbaijan tourist board - a deal which raised eyebrows. It paid a reputed €12m (£9.8m) for an initial 18-month deal. The well-documented human rights abuses in that country stirred debate about the suitability of this sponsor.

Furthermore, in 2011 it was also reported that Atletico owed €52m (£42.7m) in wages to their own club staff. That was around 81% of the total wage bill. During his last spell at the club, playmaker Diego filed an unpaid wages complaint for around €59,000 (£48,400).

There is, at the moment, a sense of stability around the Estadio Vicente Calderon ahead of the club's move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016. This is, however, an empire built on rickety foundations. How long will Simeone be around? Will he be afforded the funds to strengthen the team? Will their best performers like Aguero, David de Gea and Diego Costa be continually sold to keep the wolves from the door?

This is likely to be Atletico's one and only shot at the big time at home and abroad for a long period. They best make the most of it because they spent long enough living the high life while someone else picked up the tab. Austerity looms on the horizon.

=== Atletico president Gil apologises ===
Simon Baskett 
January 9, 2003

MADRID, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid president Jesus Gil patched up his differences with coach Luis Aragones and his team after he issued an apology for publicly criticising three of his players following a recent league defeat.

'I would like to apologise with all my heart to the three lads,' Gil told Radio Marca on Thursday. 'I never wanted to damage any of them and would like to withdraw the remarks I made.

'At times my blind love for the club has led me to damage it and I will talk to the team on Saturday and apologise personally to the players involved.'

Gil's original comments came when he lost his temper after Sunday's 4-3 defeat at Villarreal and singled out defenders Santi, Jorge Otero and Luis Carreras for particular criticism.

'There are three guys out there wearing the red and white shirt and they don't do anything,' Gil told radio station Cadena Ser.

'They're not going to laugh at this shirt any longer. They are not going to make fun of me.... It is not fair if some players give it everything only to see others spoiling things.'

Gil's comments were immediately rebuked by the players in question and the club's sporting director Paulo Futre.

BROKEN PROMISE

Aragones, who steered the team to a return to the first division last season, said that Gil had broken his promise not to meddle with sporting matters at the club.

'Gil has breached the agreement we made when I signed my contract,' he told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope on Thursday.

'He can come and criticise me as much as he wants, but not the players. None of us liked what he said last Sunday.'

The Atletico coach added that he expected a heated encounter with Gil on Thursday as he and Futre attempted to clarify matters with the club president.

'It is going to be a tense meeting that's for sure. I have to sort out a lot of things with the president and if they aren't resolved then I may not remain at the club.'

But the Atletico president did his best to calm speculation about divisions at the club when he withdrew his remarks following the meeting and reiterated his faith in the team.

Gil has been an outspoken president of Atletico since 1987, regularly picking up fines and suspensions for comments made about referees, fellow presidents and players and rarely letting a season go by without sacking at least one coach.

He was briefly removed from his position in 2000 during a financial investigation of the club and has spent short periods in prison while subsequent inquiries were carried out.

But Gil had toned down his act since the appointment of former Portuguese international Futre in November 2000 to look after the sporting side of the operation.

=== Jeezus it's Jesus ===

"I'm Jesus Gil, not Jesus Christ," said Jesus Gil today as he returned to work as president of Atletico Madrid. Long-time devotees of Jesus Gil will already know he is not Jesus Christ, but for the less-enlightened here's one tell-tale way of spotting the difference: while Jesus Christ sits on the right-hand side of his father in heaven, Jesus Gil sits in his office, surrounded by two supervisors legally appointed to watch his every move.

Gil has been allowed to return to work while the judge investigating financial irregularities at Atletico decides whether to take action against him. Gil has been questioned over the alleged misuse of as much as 9,427m pesetas (roughly 34m squid). He was also imprisoned last year while investigators tried to untangle links between Atletico and Marbella - one-time club sponsors whose mayor is a certain J Gil. Oh, and last week the club were found to be effectively bankrupt with debts of over £50m.

So what the club really needs is a steady hand in the till, sorry, on the tiller. And surely nobody can have a steadier hand than Jesus. The returning chairman's first trick will be to keep Atletico in the Primera Liga standing as they are in 19th position, four points away from 17th, and with only six games to play. It will be a sizeable achievement if Jesus pulls it off. And if coach Raddy Antic is still in a job come July, why, that'll be a miracle.

=== Jesús Gil y Gil ===
Autocratic owner who ruled Atlético Madrid with an iron hand
Brian Glanville
Monday 17 May 2004 22.47 EDT

When the football club Atlético Madrid, of which he was owner and president, won the Spanish cup and league double in 1996, Jesús Gil y Gil, who has died aged 71 following a stroke, celebrated by riding round the pitch on an elephant. Suitably enough, it seemed; the massively corpulent Gil himself was football's rogue elephant. No stranger to the courts or prison, he was blatantly autocratic in running what he regarded as his personal possession.

At Atlético, the second club in Madrid to Real, the word was that he ate managers for breakfast. In 1988, even though the team was lying third in the first division, Ron Atkinson was dismissed after six months. Between 1988 and 1994, Gil got through no fewer than a dozen coaches; two of them, Javier Clemente, who managed Spain in the 1998 World Cup, and the former Argentine star Omar Pastoriza, lasted only a month each.

Another distinguished Argentinian, César Luis Menotti, the first of the twelve and the winner of the 1978 World Cup, lasted as long as nine months, only to depart under a hail of invective. Apparently, Gil felt the elegant, chain-smoking Menotti was upstaging him. "He didn't go to work," Gil shamelessly accused him, "he preferred living by night." Yet Menotti had Atlético playing elegant football and even thrashing the detested rivals, Real.

Two of the other coaches won the Spanish cup for Gil: the Croatian Tomislav Ivic in 1990-91, and the former Atletico inside-right Luis Aragones the following season. Aragones, besides, came close to winning the first division, going neck and neck with Real Madrid and Barcelona to the very last day, but it was not good enough for Gil.

Claudio Ranieri, now at Chelsea, was another who came and went, within the 1999-2000 season. His team, Valencia, had just beaten Atlético in the Spanish cup final. Six-nil was the score: Ranieri promptly jumped ship and lived to regret it. Things went badly wrong for Atlético in the first division, and Gil bullied Ranieri into deserting his sophisticated tactics in favour of a game based on outright physical commitment. It still did not work, and the team were relegated for the first time since 1934.

Gil laid down draconian conditions for his coaches: 1. He had to agree his team choice with the president; 2. Gil was allowed access to the dressing-room before, during and after a game to give instructions; 3. Economic and financial came above technical-tactical considerations - so if a player held out on a contract, he should be "benched," ostracised and ideally replaced by a youngster; 4. All criticisms by the president must be accepted by the coach; 5. The coach must play private detective, following players around by night; 6. When the president was absent, the coach must follow the orders of the technical secretary (nicknamed "the spy"); 7. The coach play no part in transfer policy; 8. The president was to have absolute jurisdiction over players' fitness, whatever the coach and trainer might think.

"I'm the one who pays," Gil declared, "so I do what I like. The coach should train the players well, and explain their tactics on the blackboard. I'll do the rest."

Some critics maintained that Gil did not actually care about football, but used Atlético Madrid for his political ambitions, which in turn furthered his interests as a property tycoon. This was notably the case in Marbella, where he established an eponymous political party, the GIL - Grupo Independiente Liberal - in order to be elected mayor in 1991. By promising to cut crime and increase cheap housing, he overturned a socialist council he felt was obstructing his property deals.

Born in El Burgo de Osma, in north-east Spain, Gil gave up studying economics in Madrid for car-trading, and then property. In 1969, at San Rafael, near Segovia, a restaurant roof at a complex he had built collapsed, killing 58 people. His five-year jail sentence was reduced to 18 months by General Franco, and Gil turned his attention to Marbella.

In 1999, the town found itself sponsoring Atlético to the tune of £2m; while Gil was cleared of corruption and embezzlement charges, he was found guilty of lesser offences in 2002, and given an unserved sentence of six months. Last year, he was given a three-and-a-half year sentence for financial offences in connection with Atlético, and resigned the club presidency he had held since 1987.

His wife, daughter and three sons survive him.

=== Atletico boss Gil granted bail ===
Monday, April 22, 2002

MADRID, April 22 (Reuters) - Jailed Atletico Madrid president Jesus Gil could be freed on bail of 700,000 euros ($622,200) pending a criminal investigation into the alleged misappropriation of public funds.
Gil, who is also mayor of the wealthy Mediterranean resort of Marbella, was jailed last Tuesday with six co-defendants after he was accused of siphoning off 27 million euros ($23.98 million) of municipal funds for his own use and of falsifying a number of documents.

High court judge Juan del Olmo ruled that the flamboyant soccer chief, who is being held at Madrid's Alcala-Meco prison, could be granted bail, court sources said.

The sources said Gil's lawyers were trying to raise the funds for his bail.

All six of Gil's co-defendants held posts in the Marbella town council or have been employed by him. The court freed two last week, and set bail for a further three at between 300,000 euros and 450,000 euros.

Gil is no stranger to controversy and has been involved in a string of legal battles since he took over as Atletico president in 1987.

Two weeks ago, in a separate case, the high court seized assets valued at $165 million ahead of a trial related to an investigation into alleged irregularities committed during Atletico Madrid's conversion into a public limited company.

Gil is accused of misappropriation, fraudulent accounting and the signing of falsified contracts at the second division club, where he, his son Miguel Angel, and vice-president Enrique Cerezo hold 94.5 percent of shares.

This is the third time Gil has been imprisoned. He was first jailed in 1969 after one of his buildings collapsed, killing 58 people.

He was given a five-year sentence for criminal negligence but released after just 18 months following a pardon from dictator Francisco Franco.

He was also sent to jail in 1999 amid an investigation into Atletico's shirt-sponsorship deal with the town of Marbella. He denied all allegations and was released on bail after less than a week. 

=== Marbella mayor jailed  ===
Friday, January 8, 1999 Published at 00:03 GMT 

One of the most flamboyant characters in Spain and mayor of the southern holiday resort of Marbella, Jesus Gil y Gil, has been sent to prison.

He is being held without bail for alleged embezzlement and fraud. The charges were laid to suspicions that he diverted more than $3 million of town hall money to the football club he owns, Athletico Madrid, in the early 1990s.

Spanish investigators have been looking into his dealings for some time. They are interested in the way he runs the Mediterranean resort and his involvement in property development. He has also been accused of falsifying documents.

Several weeks ago police raided the Marbella town hall as well as the offices of Athletico Madrid.

Mr Gil has denied all the accusations against him. As he was led to jail he was his usual defiant self - seemingly unconcerned about the charges - saying they were part of a campaign against him by Spain's conservative government.

His lawyer has said he will appeal. Five other people, including Mr Gil's son, are also accused of involvement in the deal.

Mr Gil is rarely out of the headlines in Spain. He recently unveiled a bust of the former Spanish dictator, Franco, in Marbella town hall.

Many of Spain's political parties are united against him and he faces consistent complaints about over-development in and around Marbella.

In football, he consistently insults referees, other football club chairmen and even the manager and players at his own club, Athletico Madrid, one of the biggest in Spain.

BBC Madrid Correspondent Daniel Schweimler says that as he settles in prison near Malaga Mr Gil seems to be treating the incident like just another colourful chapter in his flamboyant life.
=== Hard sell to hard cell for mayor ===
Marbella's chief citizen laid-back over claims of £2m soccer scam
By John Hooper, Southern Europe Correspondent
Friday 8 January 1999 06.54 EST

It is bad form in the deep tan capital of Europe to get too worked up about anything. Even so, Marbella's mayor, Jesus Gil, was stretching things a bit yesterday when, in impeccable Costa del Sol style, he declared: "Everything is fine and I am relaxed."
He was, after all, entering prison at the time.

The endlessly newsworthy Mr Gil had been remanded on the orders of a judge, on suspicion of channelling nearly £2 million from the ratepayers to his football side, Atletico Madrid. It is alleged the money was diverted in 1991 and 1992, soon after the redoubtable Mr Gil swept into office.

His lawyer, Jose Luis Serra, denied the charges and said he would appeal.

The investigation by anti-corruption lawyers burst into the open last October when police raided Marbella town hall and Atletico Madrid's offices. Carlos Castresana, a senior official of the state's anti-graft prosecution unit, said Mr Gil had also interfered with contracts between the municipality and the team.

The two became linked soon after Mr Gil took over in Marbella and Atletico's players started wearing the name of the resort emblazoned on their strip. Other high-profile initiatives included doubling the police force, smothering the town with palm trees and erecting immense arches at either end of Marbella strikingly similar to those put up by Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. A populist's populist, the lumbering, lugubrious Mr Gil nevertheless won plaudits for tackling street crime, reviving investment and providing what he termed "luxury free housing for the poor".

Yesterday's reverse was only the latest of many in his incident-strewn career. The most serious was when he was convicted and sentenced for criminal negligence after a building he put up at San Rafael, near Segovia, collapsed in 1969 with the loss of 58 lives. He became the mayor of Marbella in May 1991 after his party - the Grupo Independiente Liberal, or GIL - won two thirds of the votes and 19 of the 25 seats on the council.

In the 1993 general election, the GIL put up candidates in all eight Andalusian provinces despite the fact that its leader had just been given a suspended sentence for property fraud which carried with it a disqualification from public office.

Last March, he was ordered to pay £6,000 for ignoring a ban by Fifa on his representing Atletico outside Spain. Fifa imposed the ban after he insulted its officials.

Mr Gil is facing another fine, imposed by the Spanish courts for publicly accusing a fellow first division football chairman of buying off referees.

The precise workings of Marbella's municipal finances have long been a mystery, not least - by his own account - to Mr Gil. In an interview with the Guardian in early 1993, he was asked where the money came from for his ambitious projects.

He replied: "I don't even know myself how I'm going to pay for the month ahead, and that's the way it's been for the past 12 months. Or rather, I've invented a little machine for making money, but I can't give you the formula yet."

Pressed to be more specific, Mr Gil said: "I've patented it just for myself for the moment."

=== The man from Marbella ===

Jesús Gil y Gil is a master of scandal and of much else

Aug 21st 2003 | MADRID | From the print edition
Reuters 

“A SICK cat never dies.” The old Spanish saying fits Jesús Gil y Gil, owner of the Atlético football club in Madrid and erstwhile mayor of the wealthy Mediterranean resort town of Marbella. Spaniards are used to his gall, but the latest scandal Mr Gil has been involved in, featuring an uppity stooge and a fiery singer, has made many feel enough is enough.

Mr Gil, who is 70, is a millionaire property developer. Banned last year from public office, he installed one of his lackeys, Julián Muñoz, to run the Marbella town hall. Mr Muñoz took happily to the job. And he had a new lover, a legendary music-hall singer, Isabel Pantoja. She liked her role as mayoress, and was installed in accommodation paid for by the town hall.

Alas, Mr Gil and Mr Muñoz fell out; in Mr Muñoz's version, because he upset the powerful cabal of local property developers, including Mr Gil, by limiting the land they could build on. Others suspect that Mr Gil cannot stomach La Pantoja, known as “the widow of Spain” after her former husband, a matador, was gored to death by a bull. Through his proxies, Mr Gil called for a vote of censure on Mr Muñoz and the two squared up on a late-night television chat show. “You run a gang of robbers,” shouted Mr Gil. “You are a liar and cheat,” countered Mr Muñoz. “They are both probably right,” commented El Mundo.

With the aid of old cronies, and three Socialists who suddenly switched sides (and were then expelled by their party), Mr Gil got his votes, and Mr Muñoz lost office. The new mayor, installed on August 14th, is Marisol Yagüe, another crony. One of the ex-Socialists, Isabel Garcia, formerly a fierce critic of Marbella's endemic corruption, is her deputy mayor.

Mr Gil is no stranger to controversy. In 1969 a block of flats he had built near Segovia collapsed, killing 58 people. He was jailed for five years for criminal negligence but pardoned after 18 months. He has been mayor of Marbella three times since 1991 and has owned Atlético since 1987. Politically, he set out to carve a fief along the south coast with candidates from his Independent Liberal Group, acronym GIL. A natural demagogue, he installed a bust of Franco in the town hall, cleaned up the streets, and paraded with his goons while throwing insults at beggars and tramps.

His 16 years at the helm of Atlético have been much like that. Although at one moment the club slipped to the second division, for the first time since 1934, it is now back up. In 1995-96 it won the cup and league double. Mr Gil bathed in champagne and paraded on a white horse to celebrate. And despite, or because of, his public brawls with rival football bosses, calling a French referee a “poof” and saying that his worst mistake had been to treat his players like humans, his stock with fans and Marbella's voters is high.

He is busy these days staving off a web of corruption charges that continue to proliferate. Yet he survives. In 2002 he was in jail on one charge, but was freed on bail pending investigation of a possible misappropriation of public funds. He had been made a political scapegoat, Mr Gil said. Last year he was banned for 28 years from public office for breach of trust and influence-peddling. This year he was sentenced to 3½ years, plus a fine of some $16m, for siphoning off Atlético funds and fraud; in addition he was ordered to surrender his 95% share in the club. He has appealed.

=== Atletico Madrid have been built on Diego Simeone's passion... they will go down in history regardless of result against Real in Champions League final ===

By BOB TREASURE

Amid the euphoria of Atletico Madrid's title celebrations a week ago, victorious manager Diego Simeone found the time to sneak off and log in to Twitter.

‘Because you're part of every minute of my career this is also yours' was the heartfelt message the Argentine shared with some 250,000 followers, along with a picture of himself locked in an embrace with his father on the Nou Camp sidelines.

The passion on show in that tweet is something that has always been associated with Simeone. It is passion that has made him who he is today.

Atletico Madrid aiming for Champions League glory... but how would a win rank in great European upsets?
 
Born on 28th April 1970 in Buenos Aires, Simeone's true passion became football. Growing up in an era when Argentina twice won the World Cup – 1978 and 1986 – it was only natural.
‘In secondary school they once asked us what we wanted to be…When I said “footballer” everyone burst out laughing,' the former midfielder recalled during his time managing San Lorenzo.
But it wasn't playing in Argentina that had a young Simeone fixated with the idea of doing it for a living. It was the thought of playing in Italy. And the summer after Maradona had just enjoyed his most prolific season for Napoli, he got the chance to do just that.
Simeone was playing for Velez Sarsfield at the time, where he came through the club's renowned academy, when an offer for his services was lodged by Pisa.
The Serie A side gave 19-year-old Simeone 40 minutes to make a decision, but he needed only one.
After the initial culture shock, Simeone made a good start to life in Italy, though his first stint in the top flight lasted just a year as Pisa were relegated in the summer of 1991. The Tuscan side were forced to sell the promising midfielder the following year after failing to regain their Serie A status.

Sevilla were coming off the back of a disappointing 12th place finish when they put their faith in the young dynamo to fire them up the table. A seventh and sixth place finish later, another club was in need of Simeone's services.
By 1995, Simeone had arrived at the club with which he is associated today. Like Sevilla two years earlier, Atletico Madrid has finished 12th in their previous La Liga campaign, but the Argentine couldn't replicate the immediate impact he'd had on the Andalucian side.
‘The reception people gave me for doing nothing more than arriving, and how they treated me, was more than I deserved.'
Simeone missed two months of his first season in Atletico colours with a shoulder injury, during which time the club slid perilously close to relegation – they avoided the drop on the last day of the season to finish 14th.
The next season, however, is one that will forever remain in the hearts of the Atletico faithful. A thirteen-place improvement in the league and a win against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final made Los Rojiblancos double winners for the first time in their history.

Simeone, the club captain, missed just five of 42 league games that season and weighed in with 12 goals. The midfielder was duly awarded the EFE award for Iberico-American player of the season.
Atletico and Simeone could not repeat their amazing campaign the next season though, and after managing just a fifth place finish in the league, the Argentine's head was turned by Serie A, much as it had been during his childhood.
Simeone joined Inter Milan during a dark decade in the club's history. Nevertheless, UEFA Cup success in 1998 gave the 28-year-old his first European silverware. The club never looked like title challengers though – they wouldn't win the Scudetto for another eight years – and the ambitious Simeone headed for a team who did.
In joining Lazio, El Chulo set himself up for a trophy-laden turn of the century. The Rome side had gone close to winning the league a season earlier, and the addition of Simeone and compatriot Juan Sebastian Veron to Sven-Goran Eriksson's midfield provided the muscle to complement the attacking talents of Sergio Conceiçao, Pavel Nedved and Marcelo Salas.

After beating Manchester United to win the European Super Cup, Lazio edged out Juventus to take the Serie A title in 2000, as well as the Coppa Italia, with Simeone scoring against former club Inter in the final. Another victory against Inter in the Supercoppa Italiana four months later was to be Simeone's final silverware as a player.
Advancing in years, and with a well-stocked trophy cabinet, Simeone finally overcame his lust for Serie A in 2003 and returned to Madrid to rekindle an old flame.
‘I went to Milan, I lived in Rome, which is an extraordinary city, but when I returned [to Madrid] it was as if I never left.'
Simeone saw out his time in Europe with Atletico, who had been relegated and promoted again since his original departure, and returned to his homeland in 2005. He retired in 2006 after a season and-a-half with Buenos Aires outfit Racing.
While Simeone enjoyed a fair amount of success on the continent, he was relatively unknown in Britain. That is, until that infamous incident with David Beckham – ‘The idea was to let him know that I was around, not to get him sent off' – in the round of 16 at France '98.

Much to his regret, to World Cup has so far eluded Simeone. That is not to say that the midfielder wasn't a success for Argentina, though. From 1988-2002 he won the Confederations Cup, two Copa Americas and an Olympic silver medal, as well as 106 caps – a record only surpassed by Javier Zanetti and Roberto Ayala.
Like many successful Argentine footballers, Simeone forged a name for himself in Europe, and as a result never won a single club trophy in his homeland as a player. That duck would be broken by Simeone the manager.
Immediately after retirement, Simeone began his career as a manager at Racing. His early promise was enough for Estudiantes to take a gamble on his services – a gamble that resulted in the club's first league title in 23 years.
When asked about how he turned the La Plata side around, the burgeoning manager revealed that he reignited the players' hunger by showing them the famous Al Pacino speech from Any Given Sunday.
After another league title with River Plate, and ill-fated spells with San Lorenzo and Catania, Simeone received the managerial call-up of his dreams. Just as in 1995, Simeone was tasked with awakening a sleeping giant.

When the club demigod took the reins in December 2011, Atletico Madrid were tenth in the league and had just been eliminated from the Copa del Rey by third division Albacete. 16 managers had come and gone since 1996, as had Sergio Aguero and Diego Forlan, and the club had racked up over £400m worth of debt.
In short: they were in a crisis. ‘[Upon his appointment at Atletico] We gathered in the dressing room and I told them I knew this place and what the people needed. And that the only thing that wasn't negotiable was effort.'
By the end of Simeone's first season as manager, Atletico had narrowly missed out on a Champions League spot and won the UEFA Cup. Two years later, the Super Cup, the Copa del Rey and the La Liga title have all turned up at the Vicente Calderon.
The sleeping giant has been well and truly awoken.
Incredible: Simeone and Co will go into the history books regardless of the result against Real Madird

As a footballer, Simeone was passionate, hard-working, relentless, and above all: a winner. He once described his playing style as like ‘a man holding a knife between his teeth', and watching Atletico play today, it's clear they have been built in his own image:
‘Atletico Madrid play like Simeone – tough, focused and tactically perfect,' said Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti recently.
On Saturday night, Ancelotti will have to find a way past Simeone as Atletico join their great rivals in Lisbon for their first Champions League final in 40 years.
Of course, this Atletico Madrid side will go down in history and Simeone will be a winner regardless of the result. But there's no way you could tell him that.

=== Atletico Gil ===
January 19, 2011

Recently there was an article in the Guardian in which Louise Taylor pondered whether a democracy or a benign dictatorship would benefit a club more. I'm over simplifying a bit, go and read the article yourself. But the subject of an overall power at a club is something that I'm going to cover in this series…

This originally wasn't going to be a series, but as I was researching and gathering material about the gentleman above, I found items relating to some other “colourful” characters. So now we have a mini-series which begins today in Spain, then we'll move to Italy before going back to Blighty.

– Before we look into the jacuzzi above, let's look at the club first:

Atlético Madrid with the Europa Cup in 2010

Not going to ask what that creature is doing in the badge. Don't think we want to know.

Atlético Madrid managed to win the European version of the Rumbelows (League) Cup last season despite drawing most of their way to the final. That coupled with the fact that they managed to hang on to Diego Forlan after he had a good World Cup… obviously decided to stay as the big fish in a small bowl… Means that like with Manchester, people (outside of Spain at least) know that there is more than one team in Madrid. There are a few.

The club has a rich and varied history, winning lots of things domestically. But before their Europa Cup triumph last year you have to go back to the 1970's for their previous European successes.

Then as you know in May last year, as a warm up for the World Cup, the ex-ManU player Forlorn scored twice:

This season they were in the Europa again but didn't do so well this time. Went out in the group stages.

The man:
Where do you start ? Most of you pretty much know who the late Jesús Gil was, but I want to add something here for people who might not know the very adventurous past of the one time president of Atlético Madrid.
Gil the cowboy
– Gil started out in the construction business but was jailed in 1967 when one of his buildings collapsed, killing 58 people. He was eventually released after allegedly paying a sum of money.

Then we fast forward to 1987 when he was elected President of Atlético and this is where things really kick off..

From the very beginning he initiated a volatile relationship with fans, reporters, players and head coaches (his own and the opponents). He shut down the youth academy, which saw rising star Raúl switch to Real Madrid. He was despised by many of the Atlético fans.

Winning the La Liga became an obsession for Gil and he went through many head coaches before Raddy Antic finally delivered the league title in 1996 – the club's first in 19 years.

I've only scraped the surface… There's much much more so I asked Kenny Legg, curator of Adventures In Tinpot to put something together which documents some other incidents involving Gil.

Kenny went away and then came back with a long list which you will uttter “wtf!” quite a few times when reading. I wanted to include the entire thing here, but as I said it is long so I created a dedicated page:

Gil By The Numbers

Go and have a browse once you've read this post. Below I've taken a few “highlights”:

* 2,500,000 – Amount in pounds that Gil's first signing as President of Atletico Madrid in 1987, Paulo Futre, admitted to receiving in illegal payments from Gil. He went on to oversee another 140 transfers in his years in charge at Atletico.
* 93 – Number of days Ron Atkinson lasted as manager, before being fired by Gil in 1989. In total Gil employed 39 managers in his years 16 at Atletico.
* 18 – Number of months that UEFA disqualified him for for calling a French referee a homosexual. “He was offered a blue-eyed boy. I know, I've seen him,” said Gil.
* I cleaned up these for this post, you can read the entire page here.

Then there was that time with José María Caneda…

Caneda was the president of a lower league team and along with the CEO (Fidalgo) of the club they confronted him which was broadcasted live on television in front of the Professional League headquarters:

Oh and he was only getting warmed up, when he was the mayor of Marbella...

No I'm going to stop here because this could go on. Anyway I wanted to concentrate on his time at Atletico. If you want to know about his time as mayor look at his Wikipedia entry. Plus have a read of his obituary via the Telegraph and especially a write up by Sid Lowe in the Guardian.

– What I want to do is get to…

The music:
Prolapse
There was a band called Prolapse who existed in the 90's and were very experimental, mixing in shoegazing, punk and krautrock.

The group's line-up comprised of “Scottish” Mick, Linda Steelyard, David Jeffreys, Patrick Marsde, “Geordie” Mick, Tim Pattison and Donald Ross Skinner.

They formed in 1991 at Leicester Polytechnic, “With the aim of being the most depressing band ever”, and earned a cult following for their live set, particularly for the tension within songs such as “Tina This Is Matthew Stone“, which were not so much sung as acted to a musical accompaniment.

This sort of style would continue through their output and in 1994 they recorded the song: “Surreal Madrid”, which as you may have guessed from this posting is about the man subject.

The song itself is in the same sort of format at the Tina This Is Matthew track, in that rather than having a traditional verse/chorus/verse, the lead singer Scottish Mick does a sort of biographical look at Gil.

Selected lyrics:

Backroom banditos, crucifixion put aff for the next 10
minutes. Jesus Gil emerges from the boardroom, visibly
broken, sweat pouring down his face, or so you think…
Athletico must conquer the mighty Real's stranglehold
Athletico must be ready to take over the mantle
Jesus Gil once said of his supporters: “They're a bunch of
layabouts from the lower classes. A member who doesn't
have a drug addict in the family, will probably have a
prostitute.”
Still regaining 60% of support from the supporter. Jesus Gil.
Jesus Gil, scored the highest rankings from the highest
meddling and bankings. Underhanded operations were his
forte. Overhead wans tae.
He never hit the crossbar, he never hit the posts, straight in
the goal. The Bank of Spain is cancer.
“GOAL”
… to Jesus Gil.

=== Of mavericks and monkeys ===
BY PHIL BALL
Feb 11, 2003

My father used to say it, my grandfather used to say it, and no doubt I'll start saying it soon to my son, but it does seem to be the case that there are a lack of 'characters' in the game nowadays.

Of course, it's always worth looking carefully at words that spend their lives being bandied about - and this one certainly qualifies.

Besides, the post-Hornby generation of British football scribes has chosen to use the term 'maverick' for anyone who is deemed to have been vaguely interesting, and there have been the inevitable rash of books on the topic.

A maverick was someone like Peter Osgood, Frank Worthington, George Best, Stan Bowles etc - chaps whose dodgy haircuts and natural flair for the game led them to believe that concepts such as training, tactics, fitness and self-discipline were the territory of limp-wristed conformist wimps.

Most of these mavericks have now managed to ghost reasonably successful autobiographies, and most of these books have their soundbitten moments. They were all great players, were probably all difficult to play and train with, and they all have a decent anecdote or two to pass onto the next generation.

But the true value of these men was in their actual performances, not in their latter-day attempts to make a buck or two to supplement their pensions. Not that one can blame them for this, but the very existence of these books suggests that the 'character' has indeed disappeared from contemporary football, crushed under the sheer weight of training manuals, schools of excellence, mineral water and bed before midnight - no puns intended.

As far as Spain is concerned, I'm no expert on the mavericks of their past, although I've been told of a few personajes - an ironic term that is as close as you can get to the English idea.

Zamora, Kubala, 'Magic' Gonzales, Juanito - but the last one that I can remember is probably Barcelona's forward Stoitchkov - a man so hopelessly pumped-up that he once chased a hare round the Camp Nou for getting in the way and denying him his hat-trick, the poor animal having been released by Atlético Madrid fans just as the Bulgarian was about to curl the ball into the far corner.

And the Atlético Madrid connection is the spur for this week's theme, their goalkeeper being one of the last living examples of this breed, the 'character'. I hesitate to label 'Mono' Burgos a maverick (neither was Stoitchkov), because he trains and sweats along with the rest of his colleagues, is happily married with two children and has yet to be found in his hotel room in the wee small hours with an ex-Miss World.

But Mono (Monkey) Burgos, so called due to his endearing habit of exercising under the crossbar in chimpanzee-like fashion, is a true throwback to the days when footballers spoke to journalists as if they were normal human beings uncensored by the glances of their agents and sponsors. He is fast becoming a cult figure, not only among Atlético's supporters (who have always appreciated a few rough diamonds among their ranks) but right across La Liga's board.

Burgos is in the news at the moment because he let slip a harmless shot by Sevilla's Freddi last Sunday, allowing it to squirm under his body and over the line - although subsequent images suggest that the linesman was wrong to signal a goal.

No matter. The goal was an extraordinary affair, and seemed to take an age. Burgos, who seemed initially unaware that the ball had slipped beneath his bulk, suddenly realised that something was awry, sat up and turned around, but insufficiently to get the ball into his line of vision.

When he realised that a further 90º turn was required, the ball had rolled agonisingly over, or not quite over, the line. The Argentine belongs to the Barthez school of goalkeeping, his occasional public lapses more than compensated for by his frequent brilliance.

Like his French counterpart, he prefers the spectacular leap to the more boring option of good positional sense, but where he differs radically from Barthez is in the image stakes. Germán (his real name) is a huge bear of a man, with an unkempt mane of hair spilling down his back in the manner of a 60s rocker.

“	The rumour mill has it that The Garb will turn out as support for The Stones, or that El Mono will take Jagger's place for a couple of songs, thus fulfilling his dream of a strut alongside his hero, Keith Richards. ”
The appearance fits the man however, since Burgos has his own band, 'The Garb' (an acronym of his initials, Germán Adrian Ramón Burgos) and has developed a fairly tuneful growl halfway between Iggy Pop and Billy Idol. Like the former, he sings stripped down to the waist, and one of his tattoos announces 'Gimme Shelter', a clear reference not to his defenders but to his real heroes who, incidentally, are to open proceedings at the Vicente Calderón in June when Atlético celebrate their centenary.

The Monkey's band are resident in Argentina, since their leader, keen not to be seen as straying too far from the straight and narrow, insists that he only plays and rehearses in summer when he returns to his native land, or when the band come over to Spain. But the rumour mill has it that The Garb will turn out as support for The Stones, or that El Mono will take Jagger's place for a couple of songs, thus fulfilling his dream of a strut alongside his hero, Keith Richards.

Far be it from me to suggest that a person is automatically a 'character' because he sings in a rock band, but Burgos has made Atlético Madrid worth watching again, and gone some considerable way to limiting the damage done by his superiors at the club.

He's a funny, attractive character, who although not quite in the Eric Cantona line of seagull soundbites can nevertheless come out with some classics of his own. His most famous line was after a run of defeats earlier this season: 'Even when you're winning you still have to got the toilet, so when you're losing there's no need to go and shut yourself up in a submarine.' Hmmm.

He also pointed out, in an interview with the magazine 'Don Balón', that 'In football there's poetry, but you have to imagine it yourself.'

Burgos would, however, be horrified by accusations of pretentiousness, since he is working-class and proud of it, and only last week announced that he was happy to stay at Madrid until he retires because he feels that he can identify with the social background of the average Atlético devotee.

German Burgos: I suppose a rock's out of the question?
German Burgos: I suppose a rock's out of the question?
Cynics might point out that maybe the notoriously thuggish element of Atletico's 'ultras', the Frente Sur, have taken their cue from the craggy 'keeper who laid out Espanyol's Serrano in 1999, when he was keeping goal for Mallorca.
The famous punch, effected with power and subtlety as Serrano was standing in the six-yard box waiting for a corner to be taken, earned Mono Burgos a 12-game ban - a judgement which he nobly accepted on the chin, as it were.

His only justification for the action was that Serrano had been calling him a capullo (prick) all game, but that when he changed the insult to Sudaca (a racist slur term for a South American), he had to take action.

His stoical attitude to the ban moved the press to take his side, and they've been faithful ever since. Burgos now returns the favour with his famous on-field lapses and spontaneous chin-wagging into the post-match microphones.

After the Seville game this last week, his view of the blooper was typically upbeat, again demonstrating a rare appreciation of the fact that football is actually a sport: 'Hey - you have to laugh! I just didn't judge it properly. But who cares? We still drew. We still played well. These things happen. Nothing to have a heart-attack about!'

With further appalling scenes at Sporting Gijon's game against Numancia on Sunday, with several players and stewards conducting themselves like a bunch of psycho thugs, long live characters like Mono Burgos. At least he beats people up for the right reasons.

=== Jesus wept ===

Day eight of the WSC advent calendar and we have Jesus for you. Former Atlético Madrid president Jesús Gil, that is. In issue 157, March 2000, Phil Ball reported on how the club had been thrown into disarray by the arrest of their controversial ex-president on charges of embezzlement

So this time it really does look like curtains for the most famous man in Spain, the man who once dec­lared that if they sent him to prison he would buy the building from the town council.

Jesús Gil y Gil has been in prison before, most notoriously in the early Seventies, when a block of flats built rather hastily by his fledgling building company collapsed, killing over 50 residents and passers-by. He was released on Franco's death, when a generous and widespread amnesty aimed mainly at political prisoners somehow managed to include him as well. Con­spiracy theorists pointed to rightist elements in the tran­s­itional government who were worried that Gil had too much dirt on them, a tactic that has served him well over the past 25 years.

But now Gil is the last of the old school, and some­one decided he had to go. Gil is being accused of an astonishing litany of financial jiggery-pokery, all of which, of course, he denies. For the supporters of At­lético Madrid, the news is that their ex-president, his son and the club's accountant were systematically em­bezzling the institution that they claimed to love so much. Or, as the editorial of El Mundo succinctly put it, “slapping the supporters on their backs with one hand and pissing on them with the other”. 

It is a testament to Gil's twisted charisma and stay­ing power that, until now at least, the fans have all been behind him. The public administrator and his team that have taken over the running of the club while con­tinuing their investigation into the cooking of the books have already been threatened by Bastión, the shady, neo-nazi group of supporters who were al­leg­edly responsible for last year's murder of a Real Soc­iedad fan and who admire Gil for his bullish style and his interesting political views. 

Gil's political party, based in Marbella, represents one of the great crimes of semantics, its name being constructed to provide an acronym which spells his own surname: Grupo Ind­ependiente Liberal (Independent Lib­erals). Lloyd George may well be doing sev­eral turns in his grave. 
Interestingly, it is as mayor of Marbella that Gil has allegedly been running his fraud­­ulent operations. One of the most amazing accusations, recently brought to light by Gil's Socialist Party opponents in Marbella, is that of the £35 million he and his acolytes are supposed to have stolen from Atlético Madrid between 1987 and the present, £6 million were gained by selling a Brazilian player, Maximilian de Oliveira, from Un­ión Deportivo Marbella to Atlético in 1997. 

Since the Marbella club is own­ed by Gil's municipal administration, it means that in effect he sold the player to himself. The Socialists have pointed out that not a pes­eta of the transaction has ever app­eared in the town coun­cil's cof­fers: private and public fraud, and this is just the tip of the ice­berg. 

It's not just Gil who is beginning to sweat. Several of the cur­rent Atlético players are under in­vestigation from the tax office, most notably Kiko, who allegedly only declared half of his earnings in the last tax year. The practice of accepting wages paid under the table, as Kiko allegedly did from Gil, is followed by a high percentage of the Spanish population, but is one that might as well come to light under this type of high pro­file trial. The real problem for the club is that several players, Kiko among them, have already started to mumble about leaving at the end of the season, although, of course, they may be playing for a prison team by then. 

Gil has always main­tained that the world is against Atlético, and that the whole affair is a plot hatched by faceless pinkos and pin-striped young whippersnappers looking to make a name for themselves. 

Exactly what the club stands to lose as a result of the scandal is still open to speculation but, as further de­tails are to be revealed of the lost property and funds that their mem­­bers have innocently been forking out for over the past 13 years, the thugs of Bastión just might begin to reconsider to whom they pen their threats in the future.

=== Death of the president ===

Isidro Langara explores the reasons behind the deaprture of Jesus Gil from Atletico Madrid

Goodbye to the great entertainer. Atlético Mad­rid's controversial president Jesús Gil y Gil has announced his resignation, claiming it's the “best thing” for the club over which he loom­­ed large, figuratively and literally, for 16 years.

A director since 1982 and a member since 1980 (although he supported Athletic Bilbao as a child), Gil became president in 1987 – and has been compelling viewing ever since.

This is the man who celebrated the 1996 dou­ble by riding round Madrid on an elephant, who has physically attacked opponents, gone through 37 managers since 1987, and turned Real Madrid-baiting into an art form. As flam­boyant as he is fat, Gil has always been good for a laugh; whether he was good for Atlético is another matter. A figure of fun for years, many Atlético fans came to view him as al­together more sinister, cha­sed by the courts and dragging the club to a painful death.

After living in a brothel to pay his way through university, Gil became a second-hand car dealer before moving into construction. In 1969 a development in Segovia collapsed, killing 58; the building had been con­structed without an architect, surveyor, or pro­per plans. Gil was granted clemency by Gen­­eral Franco. 

In 1991, Gil became Mayor of Marbella, lead­ing his own party (the ever-modestly nam­ed Grupo Independiente Liberal, GIL), but re­signed last year following allegations of em­bezzlement. He was imprisoned to prevent him tampering with evidence – his third stint behind bars and one of 80 court cases in which he has been involved.

Investigations have also focused on irregularities at Atlético: a judicial administrator controlled the club when they suffered relegation in 1999-2000; Paulo Futre admitted re­ceiving £2.5 million in backhanders; the shirt sponsorship by Mar­bella council landed Gil in court; and this year Gil was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, for buying 156,542 Atlético shares with an allegedly “fictitious” payment upon floatation in 1992. He also had to repay £10m allegedly pock­eted via false contracts, but still wal­ked free – pending a Supreme Court (or even Constitutional Court) appeal, which could take years. 

Gil may have escaped, but the impact was pro­found. Even he saw that his reputation damaged the club, which is as much as €80m (£58m) in debt. Gil's very pre­sence was an obstacle to rescuing Atlético. Lo­cal government refused assistance with him in charge, a projected (and still unconfirmed) share issue requires the all-clear from the courts, and Madrid deputy mayor Ignacio del Rio was considering investing heavily – but not while Gil remained. Even Gil's director son, Miguel-Angel Gil Marín, encouraged him to leave. 

Yet, Gil's decision appears more personal, based in part on his tempestuous and worsening relationship with his staff. Gil made a now infamous outburst after Atlético lost 4-3 at Villarreal in January. Describing the per­form­ance as “an absolute disgrace”, Gil told SER radio: “Carreras, Santi and Otero aren't good enough – I feel like not paying them!” 

They already hadn't been paid for three months. 

Gil apologised, but the conflict remained. The final straw came on Atlético's centenary, when a dreadful performance had Gil ranting: “I'm sick of these fortune-earning, so-called professionals… they don't deserve to live!”

The fans were sick of him, too. The Anti-Gil banners have increased steadily, while chants of “¡Gil, cabrón, fuera del Cal­derón!” (Gil you arsehole, get out of the Cal­derón!) have grown in volume. His grip had loosened, the “persecution” of politicians and judges and those atléticos he thought were on his side had become more intense. Gil no longer had the stomach for a fight: “I can't take any more,” he shrugged. And then he walked away. 

Only it's not quite that simple. Gil remains the club's owner, with a 95 per cent shareholding, and he won't let that go for free. “It's time,” he said, “for my attackers to put their mo­ney where their mouths are.”

=== Aragones shows his cojones ===
Aragonés shows his cojones 

Sid Lowe
Monday October 20, 2003 

====    ====
Rejoice! For Spain's favourite mentalist manager, Luis Aragonés, is back. Out of action since angrily departing his third tempestuous spell as Atlético Madrid boss at the end of last season, the creature they call The Wise Man of Hortaleza - and for Wise, read Mad - was last week named new coach at low-lying Real Mallorca.
====   ====
It was a decision that delighted comedy fans - devotees of Luis's big-mouthed, pitch-side harangues of friends and foes. Like the time he - a white-haired, simian nutter in his sixties - launched a touchline attack on Real Madrid's 30-something Fernando Hierro for being "Old! Old! ... More than old!" or when he spent 90 minutes berating Real Sociedad's bemused and giggling (not to mention goalscoring and winning) Darko Kovacevic for having an "idiot's face" and being "rubbish as well as stupid". In fact, for being "even more rubbish than your prostitute mother."
====   ====
The Madman of Hortaleza, now 65 and with over 700 games under his managerial belt, revealed that he decided to go back because his wife couldn't cope with him being round the house all day. Which didn't surprise anyone who's ever seen him in action, who's witnessed him - on two separate occasions - attack a television cable with a pair of pliers because it was suspiciously close to the dugout.
====   ====
And what better place for the return of Luis's pliers-to-wires tomfoolery than his old stomping ground, Atlético's Vicente Calderón? Against the man he accused of stealing his Atlético job, Gregorio Manzano, Luis had the chance to hammer a really, really big nail into his coffin. Atléti went into last night's match against Mallorca second-bottom, with just four points from six games and Manzano was under pressure (dum dum dum da-da dum-dum).
====   ====
And that pressure was greater still after the week's sniping and winding up, even if Manzano denies Luis' furious claim that he indulged in a spot of still-warm (still-occupied, in fact) grave jumping. Manzano is backed up by Atlético chairman Enrique Cerezo and major-shareholder-come-tubby-Godfather, Jesús Gil y Gil, who both deny it, too. Although, as fraud trial veterans, they're not exactly the star witnesses you'd choose for a watertight case.
====   ====
No longer chairman, Gil was supposed to be keeping his ample gob shut these days but that was always going to be a tall order anyway and with Luis back and sparking off again, the run-up to last night's grudge match turned into another bout of old-style sabre-rattling at Atléti. It was as if Gil and Luis have never been away.
====   ====
Luis kick-started the fun by telling El Mundo Deportivo that Manzano "lacked respect". "I know more than Manzano from here to New York", he said respectfully, shuffling towards the microphones in his vagabond shoes. "He's been training for four years and I've been doing it for 28."
====   ====
Then he turned on Gil and his "puppet" chairman, Cerezo. "I'm not angry, I don't feel rancour towards anyone," Luis said slightly angrily. "But I don't forget. I find people's slaves pitiful. I don't dislike Cerezo: I just feel sorry for him."
====   ====
But while Manzano only responded quietly - if infuriatingly always in the third person - and kept a pretty low profile, Gil certainly didn't. Just for a change, like.
====   ====
Lacking an interviewer, he decided to grill himself (that's ask his own questions, not shove a stick up his own behind and rotate himself over a charcoal fire), and kindly send the answers to the press.
====   ====
Having asked - and answered - some real toughies like Why are Atléti struggling compared to Real? (because "Madrid are protected by God, Jesus, the holy Spirit and the government", of course), Gil ripped into Aragonés.
====   ====
Luis, Gil said, "left by the back door and produced a disgusting spectacle in La Caixa [bank], where he wanted his [severance] money, 250 million ptas [c. £1m], in cash! I thought Cerezo was wrong to even give him that; he should have got nothing. Meanwhile, Manzano was a gentleman and didn't sign anything. Luis is lying like a scoundrel."
====   ====
Well, it takes one to know one.
====   ====
And worse followed. Gil accused Aragonés of wanting to sell Atléti's great hope Fernando Torres and the following day he actually found a real person to interview him. This allowed him to slump back in his chair, his belly - as if specially installed to project subtitles - stretched round the bottom of Canal Plus's pictures (insert your own widescreen joke here).
====   ====
"Luis is unstable and irrational," Gil said, balancing a three-course meal on his stomach. "He drove us mad last year. He fielded 38 different line-ups; one week he'd say Albertini is great, the next he'd be going 'fucking hell, that Italian son of a bitch is useless'. It really pisses me off."
====   ====
It really upset Aragonés, too. He replied that Torres "was always first choice with me" and not unreasonably pointed out that "Gil lies quite often", while remaining unmoved on Manzano. "I'm not going to shake his hand or talk to him because it would be ridiculous, utter rubbish," he said. "We're a long way apart."
====   ====
And so he didn't. Last night, Luis, who knows the Calderón inside out, found his way to the dugout via a rarely used passage and didn't move from the bench all game long, barely even opening his mouth.
====   ====
Even when Mallorca's Samuel Eto'o missed two easy chances in five minutes, Luis kept his lips sealed. Perhaps because he's learnt his lesson - last time Aragonés ranted at Eto'o, in his previous spell as Mallorca boss, his dentures really, honestly, grabbed the opportunity to escape. Or maybe it was just that the match itself had sent him off to sleep. After all, it was rubbish. Again. Even if, for once, there was reward for the suffering atléticos in the Calderón, Manzano winning a 2-1 victory over Aragonés thanks to a brilliant 93rd minute free kick from Jorge.


=== Aragones - Guillem Balague's view ===
====   ====
As I make the rules here, I'll introduce a new one. The man of the weekend was not a player (although he was once, and a very good one) but a coach – Luis Aragones. Mallorca 1-1 Real Sociedad was his 750th match as a coach in La Liga. He made his debut in 1974 with Atletico Madrid, his beloved club. He has been in charge of Atletico, Betis, Valencia, Sevilla, Espanyol, Barcelona, Oviedo and Mallorca. He is a hard man with no manners but he has the virtue of making players listen and respect his words. With a great psychological capacity, he is known as the Wise Man of Hortaleza, the place where he is from. He is not the coach with most titles (only one league, four cups, one intercontinental and one Spanish supercup) as he has always preferred to enjoy his work rather than coach the best – because of that, after taking Mallorca to the Champions League, he signed for Atletico Madrid, who needed him in the hell of the second division.
=== Rayo stadium ===
====   ====
If you travel to the barrio of Vallecas in the south east of Madrid you will find one of Spain's more unconventional clubs, Rayo Vallecano. Rayo, which means lightening in Spanish, was founded in 1924 and kicked around in the local leagues for the next 25 years, By 1949 they were the district's senior team and debuted in the Tercera league as a subsidiary of Atlético Madrid. The club also adopted its distinctive red sash in 1949 after receiving shirts from Club River Plate of Argentina, who had used the club's Campo de El Rodival for training in the lead up to a friendly with Real Madrid. El Rodival remained the club's home ground until the mid-fifties, when it moved to Campo de Vallecas, the former home of Atlético Madrid.
=== Atlético de Madrid: How to Get Out of a Slump ===

By any measure, it shouldn't have happened: Club Atlético de Madrid (ATM) had a budget of around 54 million euros, outspent only by the two other major clubs in Spanish soccer, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. ATM boasted an excellent roster of players. And its chances of continued success were bolstered by the still-fresh memory of the double it pulled off in 1996 - trophies for La Liga and the Copa del Rey. Nevertheless, on May 7, 2000, the red-and-white-striped team known affectionately as "el Atleti" would end up living up to its other nickname - "el pupas" or "the jinxed." In a fateful final match at Carlos Tartiere Stadium in Oviedo, ATM arrived at halftime trailing 2-0, but managed to tie the score in the second half. With just minutes remaining, the referee called a penalty in favor of ATM. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink - infallible up until then - would be the one to take the shot from 11 meters out. But the ball did not go into the net, and ATM was demoted to the 2nd Division for the first time in its history. At the end of that same season, ATM had a chance to redeem itself in a championship game of the Copa del Rey against RCD Espanyol. Some 25,000 ATM supporters flocked to the stadium in Valencia for the final, only to see their team lose yet again and squander what could have been the consolation prize following a disastrous season. That defeat, coupled with the demotion, caused fans to vent their anger during the last encounter of the season, a home game for ATM at Vicente Calderón Stadium. The concern that had been mounting in ATM's marketing and communication department became even more serious. Fan morale was at an all-time low, and attendance for the upcoming season was in jeopardy. Radical Marketing

The fall from grace spelled financial disaster. Overall, club managers estimated they stood to lose 40 million euros - half of which was generated by television rights and other contracts that were subject to the team remaining in the 1st Division. One of the first consequences was the fire sale of many of the team's players, whose salaries were no longer affordable: Valerón, Molina, Baraja, Hasselbaink and Solari, among others. Emilio Gutiérrez, ATM's director of marketing and communication, chose a path of "radical marketing," involving crisis management and contingency planning, as well as more creativity, courage and risk, with the focus exclusively on achieving short-term results. Furthermore, Gutiérrez believed the solution to the problems that ATM faced must be rooted in the unique spirit of the club itself. But how? A Hell of a Campaign 

To make it clear that the club was putting its fans ahead of money, the club introduced a new pricing structure. Since the team was in the 2nd Division, ATM decided to charge half of what tickets cost the previous season. Not only that, but the club also promised that if the team moved back up to the 1st Division, season ticket prices would stay the same, so as to reward the team's most loyal fans. The change in pricing was accompanied by a well-coordinated media campaign aimed at boosting ATM's tarnished image. For this, Gutiérrez tapped the creative mind of Miguel García Vizcaíno, an ATM fan who had just left the ad agency Tiempo BBDO to start a new one called Sra. Rushmore. The concept chosen for the campaign was "Un añito en el Infierno" ("A Year in Hell"), which played on the emotional factor and skipped television due to its high cost, opting instead for sports press and a series of billboards strategically placed along the main beltways in Madrid. The campaign barely cost 30,000 euros. Heavenly Results

Not even the most optimistic could have predicted the results. For the 2000-2001 season, ATM saw the number of season ticket holders increase by 69 percent, going from 27,000 to 42,500. In spite of its drop to the 2nd Division, ATM remained the third most watched team in Spain. What's more, the media campaign garnered several national and international advertising awards. "Un añito en el Infierno" became a catchphrase, so much so that even now sports journalists use the word "hell" to refer to the 2nd Division. Ironically, ATM's presence in the lower division created renewed interest in Spanish soccer's Silver Division as an unintentional consequence. Another Year in Hell

Despite remaining in the public's affections, ATM did not manage to make it back to the 1st Division by the end of the 2000-2001 season. As before, the club's fate was decided in an agonizing encounter between Leganés CF and CD Tenerife. ATM needed Tenerife to lose, but it didn't happen, so ATM was doomed to "another year in hell." How to get the fans excited again? Some argued against another marketing campaign, but in the end the same agency that struck gold before proposed a new advertising blitz: "Papá, ¿por qué somos del Atleti?" ("Daddy, why do we support el Atleti?"), to which the response was "Hay cosas que no se pueden explicar. Pero es algo muy, muy grande" ("Some things just can't be explained. But it's something very, very big"). The wisdom of this campaign is the question under debate. What impact might this have on the club's flagging image? Should the club spend its resources on running this campaign on television? And most importantly, how would the fans respond?

=== Leicester City 1997 ===
Leicester's tussles with Atlético Madrid left fans simmering at injustice but, as Saul Pope recalls, these were heady days

Eleven years ago their fans would have never accepted it, but Leicester City's UEFA Cup first round tie against Atlético Madrid in September 1997 will probably be as good as it gets. Leicester didn't win the game, but for a time they were leading thanks to a player once described by the club fanzine The Fox as looking “knackered whenever he ran on to a football field”.
After he had left Leicester for Aston Villa in 1994 Brian Little never received due credit for reviving a club that had struggled for several years. At the end of Little's third and final season, Leicester were promoted to the Premier League having had three successive top-six finishes. In his wake the club continued to appoint young managers: Mark McGhee, who took the team down again, being followed in December 1995 by Martin O'Neill.

The latter endured a difficult start, with only three wins in his first 15 games. However, after a home defeat by Sheffield United in late March that triggered fan protests, Leicester won six of their final eight fixtures and went up in the play-offs. They were expected to struggle but a side built around a dynamic midfield plucked from relative obscurity – Neil Lennon and Robbie Savage came from Crewe and Muzzy Izzet from Chelsea reserves – finished eighth and won the League Cup; not bad for a team that had lost twice to Southend the previous season.

The Atlético tie was mired in controversy from the start. Leicester fans were told by the club that the only way to attend the match was to pay £279 for an official package, which didn't even include a stopover in Madrid. It then transpired that the club's vice-chairman, John Elsom, was also managing director of the travel company that had won the contract to provide the deal. The company insisted that no one was making a profit out of it, but this was difficult for many fans to believe – especially when a rival company began to advertise a cheaper package that included a stay in the city.

Things didn't get much better in Madrid. A pre-match headline in a local newspaper proclaimed that “2,500 hooligans are coming to town”, perhaps a reflection of the fact that an English side had not visited the city for several years – and laughable for those familiar with the typical City supporter. The local authorities were taking no chances, however, and supporters on the official tour were kept in a compound out of town ahead of the match, unable even to exchange money to buy food. Afterwards the blame was laid squarely at Leicester for a bullying and high-handed attitude towards those wanting to travel to the game. In response, they tried to placate disgruntled clients with the offer of a £35 megastore gift voucher – almost enough to cover the cost of a replica shirt.

Up against a team on which £34 million had been spent, Leicester set out to attack. Marshall had already gone close when he stabbed home from a corner in the 11th minute, sending the famished away support of 3,500 wild. Perceived as an unfit, scruffy journeyman, Marshall was underestimated for much of his career; a far superior finisher to his strike partner that night, the 19-year-old Emile Heskey, he was exactly the type of player for whom such moments are made. The fact that he had scored such an important goal made it, in the words of The Fox “not only an ecstatic moment, but also a bloody hilarious one”.

But it didn't last. Marshall's involvement ended after 29 minutes following a nasty tackle by Daniel Prodan. In the second half Atlético's sustained pressure led to an equaliser by Juninho with 20 minutes to go. Two minutes later, a dive by Delfi Geli led to a penalty; Christian Vieri converted, and Leicester were beaten. 

A noisy Filbert Street then hosted the city's first European football since 1961 – when Atlético had also been the visitors. Leicester dominated the first half, but without creating a shot on target. They were to be undone by poor marking, which led to two late Atlético goals, and some contentious refereeing – midfielder Garry Parker received a second yellow card for taking a free-kick too quickly and Muzzy Izzet was tripped in the area three times without winning a penalty. Post-match, O'Neill criticised referee Remi Harrel, describing the penalties as “blatant” and suggesting that the game was “one we couldn't win”. He escaped punishment for his comments, but Harrel was soon removed from the UEFA list.

Despite the disappointment, the general consensus was that Leicester had been unlucky over the two legs, and could hope to qualify for Europe again in the near future. They managed to do so in 2000 after winning the League Cup again, although the club was already in decline. Heskey had been sold to Liverpool, Marshall was with Bolton and O'Neill, now Celtic's manager, was about to relieve his former club of Lennon – only Savage, Izzet and an ageing Matt Elliott remained from O'Neill's greatest side.

New boss Peter Taylor was hailed as a potential England manager, with the press even suggesting that Junior Lewis, his £50,000 signing from Gillingham, should be in the national squad. Taylor was to fail spectacularly, however, overpaying for the likes of Ade Akinbiyi, Trevor Benjamin and a superannuated Dennis Wise. A 5-0 home defeat to newly promoted Bolton on the first day of 2001-02 served final notice that the good times were over; Taylor was soon sacked, Leicester were relegated and have not recovered since. 

In 2008 things got even worse, with relegation to the third tier for the first time ever. Though the club has quickly returned to its more usual level and is making bullish noises about getting back into the Premier League, that Leicester once gave Atlético Madrid a game in the UEFA Cup seems as distant as the bubble of New Labour positivity that was floating around at the same time.

=== Nod and a wink (WSC 160 Jun 00) ===
The murder conviction of an Atletico Madrid fan has focused attention on Spain's indulgence of far right hooligan gangs. Phil Ball reports

On the night of December 8, 1998, outside one of the turnstiles of Atlético Madrid's Vicente Calderón stadium, someone shoved a 9cm steel blade into the heart of Aitor Zabaleta, a 27-year-old Real Sociedad fan. Lost in the middle of a ruck of Atlético fans who had suddenly surrounded him and cut him off from his girlfriend, he was dead by the time she managed to get back to him.

At the end of March, Ricardo Guerra was convicted of Zabaleta's murder and subsequently sentenced to 17 years in jail. Guerra belonged to a group of Atlético supporters known as Bastión, a murky, relatively unknown band of ultras, as any extreme-right football-related organisation now calls itself in Spain.

Guerra was captured on film, along with 100 or so shaven-headed friends, bouncing up and down with a swastika in Real Soc­iedad's ground, An­oeta, dur­ing the first leg of the UEFA Cup tie. The pictures were used as evidence to nail Guerra as belonging to Bastión – a preface in the case to proving that he was the murderer.

The very fact that Bastión had travelled up to Anoeta was interesting. For reasons obvious to anyone mildly acquainted with Spanish politics, supporters of the two main Madrid sides rarely make it a day out up to the Basque Country. However, Real Sociedad's sup­porters are, by and large, a peaceable lot until provoked – and provocation was presumably the intention of Guerra and his friends that November night. Their chant, echoing out over the quietened stadium after Atlético had gone in front, has been swept under the carpet. “Fuera, fuera maricones, negros, Vascos, Cat­alanes, fuera, fuera” (Get out, get out, queers, niggers, Basques and Catalans) sung to the tune of the Spanish national anthem. At the end of the game, the official supporters' club coach, in which, worryingly, Bastión had travelled up to San Sebastián, was chased by some Real fans and stoned as it left the city. 

The day after the second leg, when the news of Zabaleta's mur­der had come out, then-Atlético president Jesús Gil was asked for his views. “Provocation,” he beg­an. “They stoned our coach up there in San Seb­astián during the first leg. They never did like losing.” He predictably offered neither con­demnation of the murder nor sympathy for the be­reaved parents. 

Bastión are clearly a different sort of organisation to Atlético's better known hooligan gang, the Frente Atlético. Alleged to have been formed originally in response to the need to control the burgeoning amphetamines trade in Madrid, they soon took on an ideological baggage way beyond the scope of Frente Atlético. When police searched Guerra's bedroom at his parents' flat they found a large hunting knife, similar to the one that killed Zabaleta, but not the murder weapon. When asked why he kept such a knife, Guerra replied that he used it for making sandwiches. 

Plastered to his bedroom walls were pictures of his heroes, among them Hitler, Franco and Musssolini. In court, the lawyer for the prosecution asked Guerra if it was true he had once signed up for a German course in order to read Mein Kampf in the original, to which he nodded proudly. The next time he expressed himself in any way was when he winked at Zabaleta's girlfriend as he was led away after being found guilty. 

The only charge they rejected was that Guerra killed Zabaleta because he was a Basque, pre­ferring the view that the murder took place be­cause Za­baleta supported “an­other team”. The jury was sub­­­­­jected to threats throughout and had the courage to condemn Guerra, but that interpretation comes over as a whisper in the ear from the pre­siding judge. 

Not wishing to fan the flames any further, a month after ETA's murder of a prominent politician, the official line is now the absurd premise that it could have happened to anyone, Basque or Brummy. Guerra's lawyer is appealing on the grounds that his client has been accused of a crime for which there is still no material evidence. Things do seem a little circumstantial, but Guerra's little wink to Zabaleta's girlfriend will hardly help his cause.

All games since between the two clubs have been marred by unfortunate chants and nasty incidents. Real Sociedad were fined by the Spanish FA last year for not removing a poster hanging from one of the stands that read “Gil y Atlético – asesinos hijos de puta” (murdering sons of bitches). That was a bit rich considering Atlético had been allowing all manner of neo-fascist symbolism to adorn their stadium for the past decade or so. The whole affair has served to high­light the depressing divisions that still exist in Spanish society, and which show no signs of going away. 

Bastión have gone to ground and their club is on the brink of relegation. Few will shed a tear about that, but it won't bring Zabaleta back.

=== When Did It All Go Right At Atlético Madrid? (May 10, 2014 by Bernard Niven) ===

Atleti Got It Right
The last time the Spanish capital's “other” club travelled to Chelsea in the Champions League, as they will at the end of this month for the second leg of a semi-final, they wound up on the wrong end of a 4-0 tonking. That was in the 2009 group stages. “Are ‘madhouse' Atlético Madrid the worst run club in Europe?” ran the headline on a subsequent article in Britain's Guardian newspaper by its estimable Spanish football correspondent, Sid Lowe, who wrote of, “A club that lurches clumsily from crisis to crisis, at war with itself ... where the players hate the sporting director, the fans hate the players and the feeling is mutual; where footballers arrive and depart by the busload ... and the debt tops €300m (£271m). Atlético Madrid must be the only place where the owners have been convicted of fraud – against their own club.”

When Atlético next met Chelsea, in the 2012 UEFA Super Cup, the Europa League holders saw off the champions of Europe 4-1. But that's more a glorified friendly than a real contest, so you can't read much into it. More telling is the fact that, at the time of writing, the club which in late 2009 found itself in the relegation places of La Liga tops the table by five points from Real Madrid, having played a game more. Two more wins would guarantee them a tenth title, their first in 18 years (the last came after a 19-year interval), and make them the only club in ten seasons to break the Real Madrid/Barcelona duopoly.

To underscore Atlético's achievement in getting even this far: during that period, only once has a team other than Real or Barcelona made the top two. The average gap between the winners and the nearest outsider club has been over 18 points.

What's happened? The most obvious answer is Diego Simeone. The single-minded Argentine manager and former Atlético player has brought about a change of style, culture and mentality whose first big pay-off was last year's 2-1 victory over Real in the Copa del Rey final, perhaps less significant for the trophy it brought as for representing the first win in 14 years against their cross-city rivals.

But the highly impressive Simeone - who, in a pleasing instance of nominative determinism, boasts the distinctly simian appearance of a hitherto unknown and fearsome species of great ape - did not pull Atlético directly out of the mire. Credit is due to his predecessor, Quique Flores, appointed when Abel Resino was dismissed following that 4-0 loss to Chelsea. Flores it was who guided Atlético to a Europa League trophy in 2010, their first significant silverware since their 1996 league and cup double. (Unless you count being one of eleven “winners” in the 2007 Intertoto Cup, which is rather like counting a gold star for attendance.)

Flores took a catastrophe of a club, not so much a sleeping giant as a drunk, drooling, dysfunctional one, slapped it into shape - like a boxing trainer in a hackneyed movie scene, filling the alcoholic onetime champ with coffee and tough talk - and induced it to go out and win something that mattered. Simeone still had a great deal of work to do, and has thus far done a sterling job of it. But he wasn't starting from scratch. Flores, who departed three years ago and is now employed in the United Arab Emirates, would be entitled to feel that his role in Atlético's recovery has been overlooked.

What was begun by Flores and has been pursued to the brink of triumph by Simeone is the stabilising of affairs on the pitch. It is a story neatly illustrated by a succession of strikers: Fernando Torres (who left for Liverpool before Flores was appointed), Sergio Aguero, Diego Forlan, Radamel Falcao and now Diego Costa. Whatever their other problems over recent years, Atlético have seldom lacked for firepower and this has been their salvation. Costa excepted, every one of these at times redoubtable talents has been sold on in attempt balance the club's books, then somehow replaced. Yet off the pitch, those books have often looked unbalanceable, and only an accommodation with the authorities over Atlético's eye-watering tax liabilities has permitted them to keep going at all.

This puts Simeone in the bizarre position of mounting a credible challenge for the two biggest trophies available to a Spanish club, in the knowledge that no matter what he achieves, the team he has built to achieve it may be dismantled at a moment's notice. Keeping hold of their players has been hard enough for Atlético. Should they finish this season with even one trophy, let alone two, their real task may be keeping hold their manager. Perhaps the question is less, “Where did it all go right?” as, “When will it all go wrong again?”


=== Are 'madhouse' Atlético Madrid the worst run club in Europe? () ===

With nine coaches in six years, no trophies since 1996 and 'encouragement' from extreme-right ultras Frente Atlético, what crisis will hit the club next?

Quique Flores

In 1969 a property development near Segovia undertaken by Jesús Gil collapsed, killing 58 people. It had been opened before the cement was dry and was built with no plans, no surveyor, no architect and substandard material. It often feels like it served as the blueprint for running Atlético Madrid, the club where Gil became president in 1987 and owner in 1992 – a "model" that has been followed by his successors, son Miguel-Angel Gil Marín and the film producer Enrique Cerezo. Tonight Chelsea visit what could well be the worst run club in Europe, described as a "madhouse" by the coach Abel Resino.

Make that "ex-coach". Resino has been sacked; he is no longer in charge of a club that lurches clumsily from crisis to crisis, at war with itself, a club where the owner, Gil Marín, and the president, Cerezo, can't live with each other or without each other either; where the players hate the sporting director, the fans hate the players and the feeling is mutual; where footballers arrive and depart by the busload but there still isn't a right-back and the debt tops €300m (£271m). Atlético Madrid must be the only place where the owners have been convicted of fraud – against their own club.

In 1969, Gil was pardoned by General Franco. Almost 30 years later, a statute of limitations rescued him, Gil Marín and Cerezo from prison even though they were found to have fraudulently acquired Atlético upon flotation in 1992. Atlético had been conned then; fans believe they have been conned ever since. They lie in La Liga's relegation zone; lose tonight and their Champions League campaign will be virtually over. But that does not even begin to tell their story.

Resino was sacked after the 4-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge, although he did not find out until the following day as no one could get hold of him. The sacking led to a surreal 24 hours in which Atlético went through nine potential coaches – nine different men with nine different profiles. The interim coach's first game ended with the side conceding a 90th-minute equaliser against nine men; the new coach Quique Flores's first training session ended with ultras from the extreme-right Frente Atlético being allowed in to "encourage" the players.

It was typical Atlético – as if Cerezo had put together a short film, condensing everything that has made Atlético such a mess over so many years into a single reel.

Jesús Gil was a big-bellied, foul-mouthed multi-millionaire who worked in a brothel, was convicted of swindling the Marbella council, punched a fellow president, abused a judge, threatened to feed his players to his pet crocodile, ditched the youth system, leaving Raúl to seek solace across the city, and admitted to consulting his horse Imperious on transfers. Which may explain the donkeys. He bought 141 players and went through 44 coaches in 17 years.

Still, at least Gil's Atlético won the double in 1996 – a success he celebrated by parading through Madrid on an elephant. Since then, Spain's third biggest club have won nothing (except the Segunda Division title and the Intertoto Cup). Real Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Zaragoza, Deportivo, Valencia, Espanyol, Betis and Mallorca have. Even Celta, Recreativo, Osasuna, Getafe, Villarreal, Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao have been as successful. In 2000, Atlético were relegated.

Gil died in 2004, having passed the reigns to Cerezo. But while Cerezo was the president and invested heavily, the real power, with 67% of the shares, was Gil Marín and things didn't improve. The battle between them made things worse. At least with Gil, it was often funny. There are still no plans, no structure, no architect. Just two men trying to out-do each other. As one insider puts it: "If Gil Marín doesn't like a Cerezo appointment, he makes another, deliberately antagonistic one himself." The problem, says the former vice-president Fernando García Abásolo is that "no one knows who's in charge."

Atlético have had nine coaches in six years; since returning to the top flight in 2002, they have brought in over 60 players and released as many again, including Fernando Torres, the standard bearer they would never sell – just as they would never leave the stadium they're now leaving. Of the signings, only two, Diego Forlán and Sergio Agüero, were unqualified successes. Gil Marín publicly complained that they were paying the price for not selling them; Cerezo publicly boasted of keeping them. Different messages, same old contradictions. Same old Atlético.

A famous advert shows a small boy asking his dad why he is an atlético. His father is stumped. There's no logical answer. It's an emotion. No other club has so embraced the loser's role, nor so internalised the identity of long-suffering faithful. But as time passes, the proudly pessimistic message looks more like an excuse for underachieving and doing nothing, a smokescreen disguising culpability. Now, the fans have had enough. Now, they've decided it's time to boot out the men who should never have been allowed in in the first place.

Blanco, the Gift Spurned by Atlético Madrid, Is Saving Real

By Rob HughesPublished: THURSDAY, JANUARY 26, 1995

LONDON: Perhaps only on the sporting field can the wonder of youth mock the folly of old men. In Madrid, there is a lad, barely out of school uniform, who seems destined to make a fool out of one soccer club president and save the face of another.

Raul Gonzáles Blanco, 17, has crossed the divide that has driven the Spanish capital's soccer passions for most of this century. Nurtured to the red stripes of Atlético Madrid, he now stars in the white of Real Madrid.

It is not his fault. Atlético had first call but abandoned him; Real picked him up for nothing and today places an $7.5 million valuation on his precocity, his eye for the goal.

When 107,000 fans in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium chant his name, when they sing of "Raul Madrid," the player's father doesn't know whether to laugh or to cry. Pedro Blanco lives for Atlético. He was born and will die faithful to it.

A humble electrician and plumber, he pledged his boy to the cause, sending him to Villaverde Alto, Atlético's nursery club, in June 1977.

The gift was obvious. Raul shone through a remarkable season in which Atlético's under-14 side devoured all opposition to the tune of 175 goals scored, just one conceded. Papa was so proud. And so bemused a few months later, when Jésus Gil, who rules Atlético as its president, dismantled the youth team in 1992.

Gil styles himself el Caudillo - the leader, or guide. He is a figure of weighty bulk, huge ambition, short fuse. He hires and fires coaches on the basis of whether a Sunday performance pleases or embarrasses him. And if the president's whim sows instability, if the coach in turn fires the guardians of the youth setup, why should Gil care? He will buy replacements for everybody, everything.

Impatience is his god, parity with Real Madrid his boast. But Gil has seldom had to account for his methods, in sport or in the building trade.

Long ago, when Pedro Blanco, never mind his offspring, was young, Gil was convicted of criminal negligence after 58 people died in the collapse of an apartment block built by Gil. An inquiry showed that, in order to cut costs, he had employed neither architect nor engineer. But Gil's contacts in high places stood firmer than his building; given amnesty by the Franco government, he never served the 18-month jail sentence.

Atlético welcomed Gil's wealth, his grandiose way of strapping gold Rolex watches onto the wrist of each member of a winning team. When the moods darken, when he preemptively dismisses managers, coaches or players who arouse his displeasure, the fanatics shrug and say, "That's our president, our Raging Bull."

In property, politics or polemics, he makes promises he may never keep. Riding on a good Atlético season two years ago, he commissioned a caricature of himself clad in red and white stripes as his running mate for the office of mayor of Marbella. He won, of course. His constructions (still standing) figure large on the Golden Mile of the Costa Del Sol. With Gil, you win some, you lose some, you seldom pay the price.

There have been two more custodial sentences passed but unserved. In 1993 he was sentenced to two months for his part in illegal land dealings in Madrid; the magistrate decided it was not worth implementing the sentence. In May 1991, he was given a suspended six-month prison term, and fined, for defaming Ramón Mendoza, president of Real Madrid.

Oh yes, the Madrid rivalry. When this season began, Mendoza, beset by $80 million in debts at Real, called a presidential election. After 10 years of struggling with the cost and the faded glory of Europe's once most regal club, Mendoza suggested he might stand down.

LATELY, THE TIDE has turned. Real Madrid looks likely to win the Spanish league championship. Atlético Madrid is in danger of be dropped down a division. The symbol of this change in fortune, the potential jewel in the crown, is the boy Jésus Gil wouldn't wait to grow up and Ramón Mendoza inherited by default.

Blanco is not a one-man team. His five goals in two months play second fiddle to Ivan Zamorano, the Chilean whose 17 goals leads the whole of the Spanish league. But from the day at the start of November, when Jorge Valdano, Real's coach, called the teenager up from the third team, Real Madrid has been Spain's dominant force.

In his debut for Real, the boy was profligate and over-excited in a match in Zaragoza. Valdano stuck with him. The next game, before a full house at the Bernabeu, Raul showed why he is preferred to Emilio (The Vulture) Butragueño in Real's attack. He scored two of the four goals his team got - and against Atlético Madrid!

SINCE, BLANCO has been a pivotal player, a goalscorer and a goal-maker, in a run that has lifted Real clear. In nine games, the team has won seven, drawn two, and gotten in 27 goals against 6.

The 100,000-plus Bernabeu crowds have inspired rather than frightened the fledgling. Butragueño has the grace, and the sense, to acknowledge that "the boy is too good to leave out. I was the same age when I made my debut, I may never get in again."

Blanco's embryonic skills help compensate for the loss through knee injury of two key Real midfield players: Michel, who is out for seven months, and Fernando Redondo, who will miss two months.

Quite apart from the immediate $7.5 million put on his head, the pulling power of a new, "home grown" Madridista is bringing floods of money into a stadium whose $8 million refurbishment contributed to debts of mismanagement.

President Mendoza has forgotten his intention to stand down. With each goal that goes in, each victory and the lure of renewed European Champions' Cup glory next season, the burden lightens. Mendoza will, he thinks, win the election three weeks from now.

So the president thinks of renewal. He has the boy, Raul, who scored twice in another four-goal romp on Sunday.

One almost feels sorry for Jésus Gil. Unless a savior comes along soon, Atlético faces a sentence even his money cannot buy off.

Youth is not the blunderer of Madrid.

=== Raddy Antic ===
His name is revered at the Vicente Calderon, and with similar affection across the city after his spell at the Bernabeu where he succeeded the legendary Alfredo di Stefano in March 1991. He lifted Madrid, including Gheorghe Hagi, Emilio Butragueno and Fernando Hierro, from seventh to first, eight points clear, before being sacked in January 1992. (Leo Beenhakker took over and squandered the lead, losing the title to Barcelona on the last day of the season.)

30.06.03. Given another award this week by Italian website Calciomanager as best young player in Europe. With half of Italy trying to sign him, he could move on this summer, although Atlético will do their best to hold on to him. Finished the season with 13 goals in the league and one more in the cup.

22.06.03. Played the last match of the season at Real Sociedad, but again didn't feature much and was replaced by Javi Moreno twenty minutes from the end. Was runner up though behind Everton's Wayne Rooney in the Bravo Trophy, awarded by the Italian magazine Guerin Sportivo to the best young player in Europe.

15.06.03. Got his first goal at under 21 level within 45 seconds of the kick off against Northern Ireland, and made it two later in the first half. Spain ran out 1-4 winners and are now favourites to win their group. Played the full 90 minutes in the derby match against Real Madrid, but was kept under tabs by the defence and didn't do much.

08.06.03. Started the under 21 match against Greece and played a big part in the 2-0 win, provoking the sending off of the Greek captain in the first half and setting up his Atlético team mate Jorge for the second goal.

01.06.03. Was in the news during the week, Iñaki Sáez saying he wanted him to stay in the under 21 squad for now to help them qualify for the European finals. He is expected to make the jump to the full international squad next season though. A quieter game this week after his explosive return, and after starting the match against Deportivo he was replaced on the hour mark by Correa.

25.05.03. The Niño is back! A glorious return for Fernando after a six week lay off, the young striker coming on at half time with his team behind and scoring two magnificent goals to give them a 3-2 win over Villarreal.

18.05.03. Had to abandon training after aggravating his injury, and will be out for at least another week.

11.05.03. Still injured, but due to reappear next weekend.

04.05.03. Injury dragging on. Rumours link him with Juventus this week.

27.04.03. Still injured and so missed out on the chance to get his first international cap in Spain's friendly against Ecuador.

20.04.03. Still injured.

13.04.03. Went down with a hamstring injury fifteen minutes in to the game against Espanyol, and could be out for a month or so.

06.04.03. Suspended for the under 21 game against Armenia after picking up a yellow card in the last match, and therefore returned to his club and took part in the friendly match at Lorca. Played the full game at Athletic Bilbao, but didn't feature much.

30.03.03. Played for the under 21 side in the Ukraine, but was marked by a youngster who was over two metres tall and had very few chances.

23.03.03. Played the whole game against Rayo, proving a menace for the opposing defence and hitting the bar after the break, although the game ended without goals. Has been called up for the under 21 international double header against Ukraine and Armenia.

16.02.03. Played for Spain's under 21 side against Germany, having an early strike disallowed and making his side's first goal for Reyes. Was replaced by Portillo midway through the second half. The youngster was in the starting line up again for the match against Mallorca at the weekend, playing alongside Javi Moreno, and was instrumental in his side's victory. Was the subject of a high tackle by Lozano which got the Mallorca midfielder sent off.

09.02.03. Called up for Spain's under 21 friendly international against Germany. Suspended this week in the league though after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season last week, and missed the game at Sevilla.

02.02.03. Another goal at the weekend in the rout of rudderless Barcelona, his tenth of the season in the league, this time leaving Frank De Boer for dead before scoring. Hoping to make the full Spanish squad for the friendly against Germany, although Sáez said he thought he still had a lot to learn.

26.01.03. Rested again in the cup tie against Recreativo midweek. Came back to the side for the weekend match against Real Sociedad, but was replaced by Movilla in the second half (onlyfor the second time this season) and his team lost.

19.01.03. Rested in the third round cup match against Xerez. Played the full 90 minutes in the Madrid derby at the Bernabeu stadium, but did not make much of a mark this time.

12.01.03. Started the cup match at Xerez, but was replaced by Jorge five minutes in to the second half. Was instrumental in giving his side a 3-1 win over Deportivo at the weekend, scoring his side's second goal with an individualist effort after beating Naybet and then setting up Correa for the third in a three minute period in the second half.

05.01.03. Two goals from the youngster at Villarreal, but they were not enough to give his side a point as they fell to a 4-3 defeat. His first came from a far post volley after a lofted cross by Contra, and the second was a near post header from Stankovic's corner.

22.12. Made an appearance in the Real Madrid centenary match alongside some of the best players in the world. As a result there were rumours that Madrid were after him, but he told the press he wanted to stay where he was. Played the full match at home to Racing, but other than a shot in the second half which the keeper saved, did not get much of the ball. Atlético lost their first home game of the season.

15.12. Started up front again at Alavés, but could do nothing as his side fell to a 2-0 defeat.

08.12. Scored the only goal in the second half of the match against Valladolid, a far post header from Albertini's free kick. Atlético move up to seventh in the league.

01.12. Had a disappointing game at Osasuna, and was replaced early in the second half by Dani. Atlético lost 1-0, only their second defeat of the season. Sporting press reported an interest from Barcelona for next season.

24.11. Not picked for Spain's under 21 friendly with Bulgaria due to his injury. Returned to the side at the weekend and scored an early headed goal from Stankovic's cross to give his side a 1-0 win over Betis and take them to fifth in the table. Could have had a hat-trick in the second half, and generally impressed.

17.11. Still injured, and missed out on the match at Espanyol. Subject once again of transfer rumours from Italy.

10.11. Picked up a bruised leg in the match at Rayo, and was therefore left out of the side for the cup match at Cultural Leonesa. Had not recovered in time for the league match with Athletic Bilbao, so did not play.

03.11. Played the full match again in the local derby with Rayo Vallecano, getting his name on the scoresheet in the second half by converting a penalty after Jorge was fouled.

27.10. Was partnered by Javi Moreno in the game at Celta, but apart from a good solo effort in the second half which the keeper saved, did not have the best of games.

20.10. Left out of the under 21 squad for the friendly with Slovenia as the co-managers tried out other strikers. Played the full game against Valencia, but did nothing of note.

13.10. Called up for Spain's under 21 European qualifier against Northern Ireland and played the full 90 minutes. Was closely marked though, and hardly had a scoring chance throughout.

06.10. Played the full 90 minutes at Málaga, but had a quiet game as his side lost with eight men on the park.

29.09. Played the full match against Recreativo, having a hand (literally) in Atlético's goal in the first half and winning a penalty after the break, getting Galán sent off into the bargain. However his penalty kick was saved by the keeper César and Atlético ended up drawing.

22.09. One of the bookings from last week was cancelled on appeal, and he therefore started the match at Mallorca. Scored the opening goal from the penalty spot, added another after the break and almost got a hat-trick near the end. Is proving that he adapt to this level in his first season in the first division.

15.09. Played all but the last five minutes in the cup match at Lanzarote, scoring the equalising goal from the penalty spot. Started the first home game of the season against Sevilla and scored Atlético's goal with a well placed header in the second half. However was sent off near the end after being booked for diving in the penalty area twice in five minutes, and should be banned for one match.

08.09. Back in Spain's under-21 side for the Euro 2004 opener against Greece. A poor result though, with Spain losing 1-0 and not getting many efforts on goal.

01.09. Now a regular in Spain's under-21 side, and started the friendly game against Hungary together with his strike partner Reyes. Had a good match, hitting the post in the first half, and was replaced by Aganzo after an hour as the managers tried new combinations. Luis Aragonés included him in his starting line up for Atlético's opening match at Barcelona. Played the whole game, and had a hand in the equalising goal four minutes from the end.

Proclaimed as the next Raúl, Fernando has risen quickly through the Spanish junior international ranks and is expected to make his full international appearance soon. Still only 19, he has already played for the under-21 side, and was top scorer in the recent under-19 European championships which Spain won. He will be making his first division debut this season having broken in to Atlético's promotion winning first team last year, and scouts from around the world will be keeping an eye on him.
=== Growing pains for 'The Kid' ===

Growing pains for 'The Kid'
By Gabriele Marcotti

El Niño — The Kid — and it is not hard to see why. With his boyish visage and gangly frame, he resembles a teenager after a growth spurt, a man-child getting acquainted with his new body. To fans of Atlético Madrid, he has always been The Kid, dating back to the August day 11 years ago when, as a ten-year-old, he was one of only three boys to join the club out of 6,000 who showed up for trials.
Today, Torres is probably the best player in Europe never to have played in the European Cup. He is to Atlético fans what Wayne Rooney might have been to the Everton faithful: one part prodigy, one part folk hero, one part native son, one part messiah. It is difficult to overstate what he means to Atlético. He is not only their captain, not only by far their best player, not only their greatest home-grown product; he is the eternal hope of youth, which is why, if he remains at the club, he will forever be The Kid.

“Atlético are the poor team of Madrid, the working-class team,” Torres said. “We don't have money, we rarely win trophies. We exist for other reasons. We give our fans an outlet each weekend to forget about the drudgery of existence and immerse themselves in the club. Of course, that means suffering with the club because we are not rich or powerful, which in some ways is unusual because fans leave their daily suffering to join Atlético's suffering. And yet we go, driven perhaps by hope that one day our fortunes will turn. It's the hope, however irrational. Atlético fans were looking for an idol and when I came along, they adopted me.”

Stop. Reread the above quote. Do those sound like the words of a footballer who turned 21 only eight days ago? Can you imagine Rooney talking in such a way? This is a young man blessed not only with outrageous footballing skills, this is a thinking footballer who in another time might have been called an existentialist.

Reflecting on Real Madrid, the club he turned down at 10 for Atlético, Torres said: “Real are rich and powerful and used to winning, so that's what the fans expect. But that means they are slaves to their success. When they don't win, they can't find happiness.”

Torres has thought about these things because, unlike most professionals, he is a fan. If he were not on the pitch, he would be in the stands. “I made the jump from the stands to the pitch literally in one week,” he said. “One game I was amidst the supporters, the next I was a few yards away, on the pitch. I lived the dream.”

Yet the dream was not always pleasant. There is an adage that suggests that “you should never wed your mistress”, in case the magic shatters against reality. “When you're a fan, you think and dream about your club every day,” he said. “You only see the good parts. When you cross the line and become a player, you see everything. That's not always pretty. But what I found most difficult was dealing with failure as a player as opposed to a fan. As a supporter, you know that if you cheer your heart out, you've done your job. But as a player, you have an extra layer of frustration as, unlike the fans, you can determine the outcome. And that's why defeat hurts much more if you're a player and a fan rather than only a fan.”

Torres had scored 55 league goals before his 21st birthday, but that is a minor part of his game. What really gets scouts excited is his rare combination of size (he is 6ft), strength, pace and technique, all controlled by a creative mind. That is why AC Milan reportedly bid £25 million for him last summer and why, according to the Spanish press, José Mourinho is a huge fan. Atlético have rebuffed the suitors thus far, but there is a sense of the inevitable. The club's financial position remains precarious and, in their hearts, most Atlético fans accept that he will not be around for ever. Torres knows this, too.

“People always ask me about leaving,” he said. “Atlético are a big club, but we don't win much. Elsewhere, I could be competing for important titles. But I have things here which I couldn't have with other teams: my family and friends, my sense of belonging. Do I give that up to chase glory? All the trophies in the world couldn't replace what I have here. Then again, I ask myself if I'm just staying in my comfort zone at Atlético. Would I push myself harder elsewhere? I tell myself there's plenty of time to move if that's what I want, but the truth is, I just don't know. If you ask me the same question in a week, I'll probably give a different answer.”

Did Rooney wrestle with the same issues six months ago? If he did, we may never know. Because Torres is a fan, he is in danger of confusing what Atlético mean to him with who he is. “This is my job, not a hobby,” he said. “Rationally, I know I have to differentiate between the two, but it's very difficult.”

Maybe one day the professional will win out over the fan and he will do what is best for his career, although maybe not for his heart and soul. When this happens, he will move on, win trophies, become very wealthy and attain superstardom. Perhaps he will win the Ballon d'Or and be hailed as one of the greatest. But if this happens he will no longer be The Kid. He will simply be Fernando Torres, the footballer.

=== Molina ===
This summer should see the end of Molina's Atletico career after their relegation and the keeper will be eager to put himself in the shop window.
Whether his international career lasts much beyond the Norway game in which he gifted Iversen the winning goal is another matter.

A dominating presence in the Atletico goal for several seasons, he was a member of the Euro 96 squad but has yet to be able to establish himself as number one ahead of Canizares or Antonio Zubizarretta.

Famously made his debut as an outfield player against - of all people - Norway in April 1996.
=== Jose Mari Romero ===

 AC Milan	AC Milan	
Born in Seville, Jose Mari Romero Payon rose among the youngsters of his local club. He made his debut in the league when he was only 18 and in 21 appearances for Seville he scored seven goals and was an instant hero. Six months later he left for Atletico Madrid. At Atletico he immediately made an impression and was a first team player from the very beginning. Nine goals in his first season and seven in his second, as well some impressive performances in the UEFA Cup - including a goal against Roma - and a hat-trick in the Spanish Cup against Espanyol attratced him to clubs from all over Europe. 

His natural talent and speed make him an outstanding forward. Claudio Ranieri, his last manager at Atletico, said: "He's a real natural force and has a great physique. He knows how to find space and is strong both on and off the ball. He has to learn how to be calmer in front of goal and then he would be a complete player." 

And what does Jose Mari think about himself: "My best quality is being modest, but i have a very short temper, which can cause problems. Since i was a child i hated school. My hobby was running on the beach. My idol is Marco Van Basten. I like movies, Julia Roberts and Mel Gibson. I drink lots of Coca-Cola and love egg and chips. I'm a very religious person and i always thank God for the way He treats me."
=== NEWSMAKER-Outspoken Atletico owner Gil rarely out of limelight ===
Fri 14 May, 2004 19:35
By Emma Ross-Thomas

MADRID, May 14 (Reuters) - Jesus Gil, owner of Spanish soccer club Atletico Madrid, one-time mayor of the jet-set resort of Marbella and a real estate magnate who served time in jail, died on Friday, aged 71.

Gil suffered a stroke on May 9 and spent six days in intensive care, semi-conscious on an artificial ventilator.

He was best known abroad as owner and former president of Atletico Madrid. But in his native Spain controversial politics, legal wrangles and property interests kept him in the headlines for decades.

Born in the town of Burgo de Osma in Soria on March 12, 1933, he spent the early part of his business career selling second-hand trucks.

He went on to make his fortune as a property developer, a move that led to his first spell in jail in 1969 after one of his buildings collapsed, killing 58 people.

He was given a five-year sentence for criminal negligence but was released after 18 months following a pardon from dictator Francisco Franco and began to rebuild his business empire.

In 1987 he took charge at Atletico and in 1991 was elected mayor of Marbella in a landslide after forming a conservative political party bearing his own name, GIL (Grupo Independiente Liberal).

He came to power on promises to smarten up Marbella, which he said was full of "prostitutes, lesbians and drug addicts".

But in 2002 he was jailed and then freed on bail of 700,000 euros pending a criminal investigation into alleged siphoning off of 27 million euros of municipal funds and falsifying documents.

In a separate case in 2003 he was handed a three-and-a-half year prison sentence after being found guilty of misappropriation of funds and fraud, although he appealed the ruling and did not have to serve the sentence in the meantime.

SIX COACHES IN A YEAR

Gil, who talked of his "blind love" for the club, was outspoken in his criticism of players and football officials -- he once said a referee needed psychiatric treatment -- and hired and fired over 30 coaches in his time as president. In a bumper year he shed six.

Gil hit the headlines in 1996 when he had a televised punch-up with Compostela president Jose Maria Caneda as the two men arrived for a meeting at the headquarters of the Spanish Football League.

Atletico won three King's Cups during his 17-year reign at the club, but the high-point came in the 1995-96 season when they broke the stranglehold of Real Madrid and Barcelona to complete a first ever league and Cup double under Serbian coach Radomir Antic.

A string of the world's most expensive players including Italian striker Christian Vieri, Brazilian midfielder Juninho and Dutch centre-forward Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink all spent time at the Calderon.

But the club failed to built on its success and after a traumatic judicial intervention in which Gil had to surrender temporary control as president they were relegated for the first time in 66 years in 2000.

After two years in the wilderness of the Spanish second division, Atletico returned to the top flight in 2002 to Gil's obvious relief.

But after he had a pacemaker fitted at the start of 2003, Gil's nervous adoration for his club was a potential health risk.

Newspaper El Periodico de Cordoba reported this year Gil's doctors recommended he should not watch a match against arch rivals Real Madrid lest his heart could not take the strain.

Gil was certainly not camera-shy and one of the most enduring images is a shot of him greeting the public at an open window, wafting a traditional Spanish fan over his ample but tanned bare belly.

The shot, splashed over front pages, was taken during an investigation sparked by Gil and a political rival trading graft allegations on live TV.
=== Jose Chamot ===

AC Milan	AC Milan	
When the chance came for Argentinian full back Jose Chamot to leave Atletico Madrid and transfer to Milan he jumped at the chance. Back in Italy after a three-year break, the 30-year-old international should be well known to ardent followers of the Italian game. Arriving from Rosario in November 1990, he played for Pisa alongside Diego Simeone and also had spells at Foggia and Lazio. Even in those days his temper knew no bounds, warranting no less then five yellow and a red card in his first season. After spending a further two full seasons with Pisa in Serie B, his next stop was Foggia, who he joined during the summer of 1993. 

However, not withstanding his habit of being sent off, usually for hurting people on and off the ball, his talent as a stopper par excellence had not gone unnoticed. In 1994, after just a season with the southern outfit, he moved up and on to the capital with Lazio for the next four seasons - earning a few more red cards as he went. However, as good as Chamot was he became a liability for a team looking for Lo Scudetto and Lazio sold him to Atletico Madrid for over 4 million pounds in 1998. 

He may say he's a reformed character but he has already missed nine games this season through suspension. Not the sort of player you would have imagined Milan needed at this point in time. But despite his disciplinary record, the Rossoneri splashed out 2.25 million pounds. 'I have already talked to Jose Mari, who tells me how great it is at Milan,' he said on arriving in Italy. But Milan's other new boy won't be the only ex-Spanish League player he will be meeting again. There's Juventus striker Kovacevic and the matter of five teeth that Chamot is missing as a consequence of a clash of heads when the pair met in a game between Atletico and Real Sociedad last year. 

'That's all forgotten now,' claimed Chamot. ' Those days are over for me. Its childish to think about things like that. I am a like your next door neighbour. I want the fans of Atletico to remember me as a kind, honest person who was very close to them. I didn't leave a sinking ship. It just wasn't possible to say no to Milan. I was playing in Italy when Milan were at the top and to play for them was always a dream of mine and now its come true.'

A car pulls up at the traffic lights. A small boy sits in the back and gazes silently out of the window, a pensive look on his face, while his father drums his fingers on the steering wheel. The hush is broken when the boy, a pleading, inquisitive tone in his voice, says: "Papa?" A sigh, a hint of resignation: here comes another one of those questions your kids ask that you can't answer. "Yes, son." "Why," asks the boy, "do we support Atleti?" The silence deepens, his father is stumped. There is no answer, no logical explanation. Why do we support Atlético Madrid?

Ask a Real Madrid fan to explain his loyalty and the answer is as easy as it is long: for Di Stéfano and Raúl, Sánchez and Puskas, Zidane and Butragueño, the two Ronaldos, for the 31 league titles and nine European Cups. The glory.

Ask Atlético Madrid fans and the answer is different – especially over the last decade. It is inexplicable, intangible. It is about sentiment, commitment, passion. "Atlético fans are prisoners of a feeling, of their colours," says Fernando Torres, the former captain who returns to his boyhood club with Liverpool this week. "Madrid's fans are prisoners of results and if results don't follow, nor do the fans."
====   ====
As Torres says, Atlético fans would follow Atlético to the ends of the earth. All too often that's exactly where they are heading.
====   ====
It was an Atlético fan, Miguel García Vizcaíno, who dreamed up the advert. "When you talk Atleti's defining values, the recurring words are passion, authenticity, realness. Arrogance just doesn't fit," he says. "People identified instantly with the advert; it summed up their feelings. Some sympathise more with Wile E Coyote than Road Runner – who always wins by cheating."
====   ====
The facile assumption is that, like Wile E Coyote, Atlético always lose, no matter what. Especially against the team they desperately want to beat, in whose shadow they live – Real Madrid. When Liverpool supporters travel to the Calderón on Thursday, most will stroll along the appropriately named Paseo de los Melancólicos. Melancholics' Way. From high in the main stand, the view is stunning. Towering over the Calderón is Madrid's cathedral, and you imagine it looking down piously, almost pityingly. You poor lost souls.
====   ====
Atlético lost the 1974 European Cup final against Bayern Munich to a freak late goal from 40 yards. The club president, Vicente Calderón, dubbed them El Pupas, the jinxed ones. It has stuck; in recent years it has become even more immovable. A sense of fatalism hangs about. Atlético have made a cult of collapse; defeat is a way of being. There's even a supporters' club called "The Suffering".
====   ====
"Atlético are the only club who presume to lose," says Michael Robinson, the former Liverpool player who now works on Spanish television. "Atlético are a stray dog that has wonderful eyes to stare at you. A dog that will never win Crufts, whereas Madrid won't even partake in Crufts if they don't think they're going to win it. Not winning proves they care more. It's almost a masochism, like an Easter procession, flogging themselves."
====   ====
Torres says: "Atlético represent a permanent battle against the odds; being an atlético means never giving in. Atlético are on their own, fighting the establishment. Kids might say: 'Why should we support Atlético when they always lose and Madrid fans are always happy?' But Madrid fans aren't happy. Supporting Atlético makes you suffer but makes you stronger. That's why my grandfather will always be an atlético and why I will be, too."
====   ====

====   ====
But Atlético's perceived "identity" does not convince everyone. Especially those of an older generation – those that remember success. Asked about the legend of El Pupas, the former keeper and coach Abel Resino responds simply: "Pah! Bayern Munich lost the European Cup in the last minute and no one says they're jinxed." Worse, talk of El Pupas, of blessed suffering, unexplainable loyalty, and a deep feeling that resists disappointment and collapse, has become an excuse for failure – a kind of smokescreen for the disastrous handling of the club. The chance to shrug and say: hey, losing is just what Atlético do.
====   ====
It should not be. One supporters' group produced an alternative video in which, over a period of time, the dad in the car has fewer reasons to give his son. "Everything we are, they're taking away from us," it concludes – from success, to dignity, to the Calderón itself, which they will soon leave, crumbling but with character, still one of the country's great football arenas.
====   ====
At long last, Atlético have a chance to lay the jinx to rest. They are already in the final of the Copa del Rey; now they have a European semi-final against Liverpool. Win and the party will be huge; maybe the biggest the city has ever seen. After all, as Torres puts it: "Atleti's successes are ours and ours alone – that makes them more real." Who knows, next time the kid in the car asks "Papa, por qué somos del Atleti?" his father may just have a logical answer.

=== comparisons with Real Madrid ===
====   ====
Until they moved it to a different part of the stadium, the entrance to Real's museum used to boast a sign that said: "Trophies tell the whole story, defining the holder." Real were simply: "The Greatest Club of All Time." Atlético's museum has a necessarily more plebeian approach, while – forget players and trophies – the club shop's best-selling T-shirt is splashed with the slogan: Bendita afición. Blessed fans.
====   ====
Would it have happened at the other end of town? "No way," Torres says. "The Bernabéu is like a theatre. They don't feel their football. Atlético is different, special." Anyone who has witnessed the Vicente Calderón as a spine-tingling roar of Atleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeti takes hold can vouch for that and Atlético fans revel in it. As one says simply: Atlético hasta la muerte; Madrid hasta la próxima derrota. Atlético until I die, Madrid until the next defeat.
====   ====
It is too easy to forget that Atlético won the double in 1996. Or that they are historically the country's third-biggest club, with nine league titles. That, having been fused with the air-force team and been rebranded Atlético Aviación at the end of the Spanish civil war, they won the league in 1940 and 1941; that, now plain Atlético Madrid in 1947, they won two more leagues at the start of the 1950s, and four trophies in the 1960s – including back-to-back Copa del Generalísimo successes against Real. To forget them beating Real in the 1992 cup final, after Luis Aragonés's team-talk: "Forget tactics," he screamed. "It's Real Madrid at the Bernabéu. They've been sticking it up our arses for so long, now it's our chance to stick it up theirs!"
====   ====
It is easy to forget that in the 1970s Atlético won three league titles, two cups and the World Club Cup. And it is easy because losing the 1974 European Cup final was more painful and, ultimately, more memorable, because of the way that defeat has been clutched to their hearts. It has been easy, too, because of Real's extraordinary success and because since 1996 Atlético have been relegated and won nothing. Since Atlético's demotion in 2000 more than 60 teams have beaten Real, but the club in red and white are not one of them. Not even once. The city derby has become Atlético's own private Groundhog Day.
====   ====
Some don't swallow it, Juanma Trueba from the newspaper AS insisting: "Atlético are a romantic myth – Atlético are Humphrey Bogart, Madrid are Cary Grant." Most Madrid fans are dismissive of them but others are irritated at Atlético's willingness to play the martyrs – as if that gives them a moral superiority. The identity survives, though.
====   ====
Torres's commitment to Atlético came from his grandfather, Eulalio, who complained that Fernando's class-mates were all Real fans. "He told me what being an atlético was all about," the Liverpool striker explains. "He didn't tell me about players, but about what it means to wear the Atlético badge, with the bear and the strawberry tree that symbolise the city. About hard work, humility, sacrifice, overcoming adversity, about resistance to Real Madrid, the city's football giants."
====   ====
Real are inescapable. Atlético define themselves against their rivals; the differences make them special. Anti-Madridismo is fundamental. The recent injection of cash may have ruined the analogy but until recently, Madrid's rivalry could be compared to Manchester's. They started life as a branch of Athletic Bilbao, but Atlético consider themselves the more authentically Madrileño team – the people's club battling overbearing neighbours with designs on a higher calling.
====   ====
Atlético like to think that favouritism, bent referees and the Franco regime explain their rivals' success. A victim complex pervades. "The directors' box at the Bernabéu is like Franco's hunting trips," Atlético's late president Jesús Gil said, yet it was he who had a life sentence commuted by the dictator. Severino Lorences, author of Red and White, insists: "The Bernabéu trophy room is like Aladdin's cave: everything's been stolen. Robin Hood stole from the rich to give to the poor, Madrid are the Sheriff of Nottingham, stealing from the poor to give to the rich."
====   ====
He adds: "Living in Real's shadow is hard. For years Madrid have been the big, rich team in Spain and we've been the poor team, the working-class club. Atlético belong to the city; Madrid are the world's team."
====   ====
As one Madrid fan puts it: Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid are caviar and cocido. Cocido is Madrid's hearty, heavy stew. Atlético fans agree. They like to present Real versus Atlético as power against people; aristocracy against proletariat; right against left (even though the hardcore are on the far right); the smart north against the real city of the south; arrogance against humility; entitlement against loyalty; favoured against persecuted; implacable winners against romantic losers.
====   ====
The Bernabéu stands imposingly alongside businesses on the Paseo de la Castellana, the Calderón is locked in by the grubby M30 motorway, which runs right under the stand. It is an exaggeration, sure, but by the Bernabéu you'll see stylish bars packed with slick hair and Barbour jackets; by the Calderón it's beer in gigantic plastic glasses, shiny tracksuits and mullets. Former Atlético player José Movilla was a bin-man; ex-goalkeeper Germán "Mono" Burgos a fan of AC/DC. "I couldn't play at Madrid because of how I look," he insists. "I'm not joking. They'd make me cut my hair. Atlético is synonymous with workers. Atlético fans are brickies, taxi drivers, churro sellers ..."
====   ====
Their centenary celebrations underline the difference. Madrid's involved the United Nations, the pope, and the king; Atlético's a huge paella for the fans. Madrid's anthem was sung by Plácido Domingo, lauding a "field of stars"; Atlético's was called Reasons for a Feeling and was sung by gruff-voiced folk singer Joaquín Sabina, in which he declared "war on arrogant [Madrid]". Its opening lines exalted "a feeling that cannot be explained", insisting: "To understand you have to have cried at the Calderón." The chorus goes: "What a way to win/What a way to lose/What a way to go down/What a way to come up/What a way to draw/What a way to suffer!" Typically for Atlético, because of an argument over the rights, it could not be played on their centenary. Instead they used the Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always Get What You Want".
=== 1900s ===
=== 1910s ===
==== ====
Founded on 26 April 1903 by a group of Basque students at the Colegio de Ingenieros de Minas, Athletic Club de Madrid was originally an affiliated body of their parent club, Athletic Cub de Bilbao. Early matches were played to the east of Madrid at a very basic ground called the Campo de Vallecas, practically on the site of Rayo Vallecano's current stadium. In 1913, the club moved to a location in central Madrid on the Calle O'Donnell. This enclosure is often confused with that of Real Madrid's, which was a hundred metres further west. Here the club remained until May 1923, when it moved to the north west of Madrid and the Metropolitano.
=== 1920s ===
==== ====
The Estadio Metropolitano was built by the Urbanizadora Metropolitana, the forerunners of today's Madrid Metro as part of a real estate development close to the city's University. Architect José María Castell used the site of a natural amphitheatre, and at a cost of 1.5 million pesetas developed what at the time, was the largest and best stadium in the Spanish capital.
==== ====
The southern side featured an open area of seating, whilst the eastern end behind the goal had a semi-circular terrace. The northern side was made up of a slim line of wooden bleachers. The west end was left open, but further standing was provided on a cinder athletics track, which ran around the club's first grass pitch. Officially, the stadium had a capacity of 25,000, but accounts of the stadium's size vary greatly, in part to the additional standing provided on the athletics track, but also the large open grass banks that stood on either side and above the east terrace. This meant that crowds of 45,000 were not uncommon.
==== ====
The stadium was inaugurated on 13 May 1923, when a crowd of 25,000 saw Athletic beat Real Sociedad by two goals to one. Whilst the home supporters were happy with the result, they and the local press were less than happy with the new stadium. Transport to the stadium was poor and when you arrived, access into the arena was congested. The Spanish Football Federation was also unhappy at the high cost of admission into the stadium.
==== ====
Athletic and the Urbanizadora Metropolitana made a commitment to improve transport, access and facilities and by 1925 the stadium had a capacity of 30,000 and improved services. Four years later, 45,000 paid to watch the Spanish National Team inflict the first defeat on England by a continental side. However, Athletic could not agree new terms with the owners and in September 1929 the club left the Metropolitano.
==== ====
How can I say this politely? Well, it's like this… Atlético Madrid has played around a bit. There you go, I've said it. You see, between its formation in 1903 and moving to their present home in October 1966, Atléti changed venues on ten occasions. However, throughout this period, the club's one true home was the Estadio Metropolitano.
=== 1930s ===
==== ====
Athletic started the 1929-30 season at Real Madrid's Charmatin stadium, and also played some home fixtures back in their old stamping ground of the Campo de Vallecas. They eventually returned to the Metropolitano in January of 1930, but the upheaval clearly did not help, and Athletic finished bottom of La Primera and was relegated. During the summer of 1930, the Urbanizadora Metropolitana carried out another upgrade to the stadium, building a covers over the southern and northern sides of the ground, but also converting the athletics track to allow greyhound racing. This didn't curry any favours with the Spanish Federation, who apparently outlawed the use of the stadium.
==== ====
So, Athletic returned to the east of Madrid and the Campo de Vallecas. The pitch at Vallecas was poor and over the next few seasons, the poor surface and disputes with the owners of the Metropolitano, saw the club criss-cross the capital, even playing matches back at Real Madrid's Chamartin. Athletic won promotion back to La Primera at the end of the 1933-34 season and played home matches during the 34-35 season at the Campo de Vallecas. The following season saw the club return to the Metropolitano, but this didn't inspire Athletic and they were, relegated. The La Segunda was the last thing on the club's mind when however, as war broke out on the 15 July 1936.
=== 1940s ===
==== ====
The Civil War hit Athletic hard. Only six playing staff returned after the hostilities and the club had debts of over 1 million pesetas. To add to their woes, both the Campo de Vallecas and the Metropolitano had been destroyed during the fighting. Drastic times call for drastic measures and in October 1939 the club merged with the air-force backed Aviación Nacional, to form Athletic-Aviación Club.
==== ====
Oviedo's inability to compete in the 39-40 season threw the club a lifeline, and the Federation arranged a play-off between Athletic-Aviación and Osasuna for a place in that season's first division. Athletic-Aviación won the tie 3-1 and started the 39-40 season back at Real Madrid's Estadio Chamartin. Under the stewardship of the great Ricardo Zamora, Athletic-Aviación incredibly edged out Sevilla to earn a first ever league title. The club retained the title in 40-41 and during the summer, was forced to change to the Spanish version of their name, becoming Atlético-Aviación. During this period, work was under way on rebuilding the damaged Metropolitano. This included a new main stand, new terracing at the east end and for the first time, a substantial terrace on the north side of the ground. The Metropolitano was re-inaugurated on 21 February 1943 with a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid.
=== 1950s ===
==== ====
On the back of two further back to back title wins, Atlético finally purchased the Metropolitano on 15 April 1950 and immediately set about improving the facilities. The architect for the work was club president and former player, Javier Barroso. The first phase saw the terracing extended around to the west end and new changing facilities were built beneath.
==== ====
Then in the summer of 1954, the club took the audacious decision to excavate the pitch and add another ring of seating where the greyhound/athletics track had stood. This increased the official capacity to 58,000, but despite the refurbishment, the Estadio Metropolitano was soon lagging behind the newer, larger stadiums that Real Madrid and Barcelona built.
====   ====
In 1959 Atlético reached the European Cup semi-final against Real. They would have won on away goals, but there was no such rule and they lost a play-off in Zaragoza with a debated goal – debated at the Calderón, anyway. "That European Cup should have been red-and-white," laments one Atlético fan. "History would have changed."
=== 1960s ===
==== ====
In 1961, Atlético purchased large plot of land to the south west of Madrid, on the banks of the Rio Manzanares. Work was slow, and with the Metropolitano sold and the club suffering financially, they moved in with Real Madrid for part of the 1964-65 season. They brokered an agreement to return to the Metropolitano for one final season in 1965-66 and gave the stadium a glorious send-off by winning La Primera. Unfortunately, the new stadium was not ready in time for the start of the 1966-67, so on 18 September 1966, Atlético played their last ever game at the Metropolitano. A 0-1 defeat at the hands of Barcelona brought an end to 43 years of football at this gloriuos old stadium.

=== 1960s ===
=== 1970s ===
=== 1980s ===
=== 1990s ===
====   ====
There is a brewery alongside the Calderón; Atlético couldn't organise the proverbial drinks there. Under Jesús Gil, they ditched the youth system because he did not see the point. Among the first to seek a new home was a 13-year-old by the name of Raúl. Atlético went through 37 coaches in 16 years. Ron Atkinson lasted 94 days and joked that he deserved a testimonial. Gil's successor, Enrique Cerezo, went through eight in seven years. Since 1996, with Gil's son Miguel Angel Gil Marín as chief executive, they have had 18 coaches. Meanwhile, the debt tops €300m (£263m).
=== 2000s ===
====   ====
There is a certain mythology about it, but the image pervades, deliberately embraced and projected. The scene in the car has become the most famous expression of Atlético, an illustration of unfathomable fidelity. It comes from an advert made in 2001. Atlético had been relegated from the first division for the first time at the end of 1999-2000. The club's owner, Jesús Gil, declared it "one little year in hell" but Atlético were already into a second season. Yet season-ticket sales increased to over 40,000, the 55,000-capacity Vicente Calderón stadium packing out weekly.
====   ====
By any measure, it shouldn't have happened: Club Atlético de Madrid (ATM) had a budget of around 54 million euros, outspent only by the two other major clubs in Spanish soccer, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. ATM boasted an excellent roster of players. And its chances of continued success were bolstered by the still-fresh memory of the double it pulled off in 1996 - trophies for La Liga and the Copa del Rey. Nevertheless, on May 7, 2000, the red-and-white-striped team known affectionately as "el Atleti" would end up living up to its other nickname - "el pupas" or "the jinxed." In a fateful final match at Carlos Tartiere Stadium in Oviedo, ATM arrived at halftime trailing 2-0, but managed to tie the score in the second half. With just minutes remaining, the referee called a penalty in favor of ATM. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink - infallible up until then - would be the one to take the shot from 11 meters out. But the ball did not go into the net, and ATM was demoted to the 2nd Division for the first time in its history. At the end of that same season, ATM had a chance to redeem itself in a championship game of the Copa del Rey against RCD Espanyol. Some 25,000 ATM supporters flocked to the stadium in Valencia for the final, only to see their team lose yet again and squander what could have been the consolation prize following a disastrous season. That defeat, coupled with the demotion, caused fans to vent their anger during the last encounter of the season, a home game for ATM at Vicente Calderón Stadium. The concern that had been mounting in ATM's marketing and communication department became even more serious. Fan morale was at an all-time low, and attendance for the upcoming season was in jeopardy. Radical Marketing
====   ====
The fall from grace spelled financial disaster. Overall, club managers estimated they stood to lose 40 million euros - half of which was generated by television rights and other contracts that were subject to the team remaining in the 1st Division. One of the first consequences was the fire sale of many of the team's players, whose salaries were no longer affordable: Valerón, Molina, Baraja, Hasselbaink and Solari, among others. Emilio Gutiérrez, ATM's director of marketing and communication, chose a path of "radical marketing," involving crisis management and contingency planning, as well as more creativity, courage and risk, with the focus exclusively on achieving short-term results. Furthermore, Gutiérrez believed the solution to the problems that ATM faced must be rooted in the unique spirit of the club itself. But how? A Hell of a Campaign 
====   ====
To make it clear that the club was putting its fans ahead of money, the club introduced a new pricing structure. Since the team was in the 2nd Division, ATM decided to charge half of what tickets cost the previous season. Not only that, but the club also promised that if the team moved back up to the 1st Division, season ticket prices would stay the same, so as to reward the team's most loyal fans. The change in pricing was accompanied by a well-coordinated media campaign aimed at boosting ATM's tarnished image. For this, Gutiérrez tapped the creative mind of Miguel García Vizcaíno, an ATM fan who had just left the ad agency Tiempo BBDO to start a new one called Sra. Rushmore. The concept chosen for the campaign was "Un añito en el Infierno" ("A Year in Hell"), which played on the emotional factor and skipped television due to its high cost, opting instead for sports press and a series of billboards strategically placed along the main beltways in Madrid. The campaign barely cost 30,000 euros. Heavenly Results
====   ====
Not even the most optimistic could have predicted the results. For the 2000-2001 season, ATM saw the number of season ticket holders increase by 69 percent, going from 27,000 to 42,500. In spite of its drop to the 2nd Division, ATM remained the third most watched team in Spain. What's more, the media campaign garnered several national and international advertising awards. "Un añito en el Infierno" became a catchphrase, so much so that even now sports journalists use the word "hell" to refer to the 2nd Division. Ironically, ATM's presence in the lower division created renewed interest in Spanish soccer's Silver Division as an unintentional consequence. Another Year in Hell
====   ====
Despite remaining in the public's affections, ATM did not manage to make it back to the 1st Division by the end of the 2000-2001 season. As before, the club's fate was decided in an agonizing encounter between Leganés CF and CD Tenerife. ATM needed Tenerife to lose, but it didn't happen, so ATM was doomed to "another year in hell." How to get the fans excited again? Some argued against another marketing campaign, but in the end the same agency that struck gold before proposed a new advertising blitz: "Papá, ¿por qué somos del Atleti?" ("Daddy, why do we support el Atleti?"), to which the response was "Hay cosas que no se pueden explicar. Pero es algo muy, muy grande" ("Some things just can't be explained. But it's something very, very big"). The wisdom of this campaign is the question under debate. What impact might this have on the club's flagging image? Should the club spend its resources on running this campaign on television? And most importantly, how would the fans respond?
