Founded on 26 April 1903 by a group of Basque students at the Colegio de Ingenieros de Minas, Athletic Club de Madrid was originally an affiliated body of their parent club, Athletic Cub de Bilbao. Early matches were played to the east of Madrid at a very basic ground called the Campo de Vallecas, practically on the site of Rayo Vallecano's current stadium. In 1913, the club moved to a location in central Madrid on the Calle O'Donnell. This enclosure is often confused with that of Real Madrid's, which was a hundred metres further west. Here the club remained until May 1923, when it moved to the north west of Madrid and the Metropolitano.
