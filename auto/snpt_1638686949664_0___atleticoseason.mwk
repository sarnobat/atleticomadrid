2020-11-21 Barcelona H. Carrasco scored with the last kick of the first half as sweeper keeper Ter Stegen strayed too far forward from the penalty area and the Belgian nutmegged the German. Barcelona, who'd gone through a summer of turmoil with Bartomeu resigning, worked Oblak but were nonetheless weakened. Suarez did not feature against his former employers. The result ended 10 plus years without a league win against Barcelona and opened up a temporary 9 point lead over them, joint top with Real Sociedad.
17 La liga clubs had tasted victory against Barcelona since Feb 2010
