2020-10-21 started the CL campaign with a daunting trip to the defending champions Bayern Munich and fell behind to 2 first half goals after an encouraging opening spell themselves. The excellent finishing by the home side continued in the 2nd half and there were fears of a loss as wide as Barcelona's 3 months earlier but instead the humiliation remained at 4 goals much like in 1974. There was a disallowed goal that would have gotten back to 2-1 which was very similar to Real's disallowed injury time equalizer hours earlier. It was their heaviest defeat under Simeone.
