2020-12-01 Bayern H. Led for an hour but a late penalty denied Atletico confirmation of progress to the knockout stages needing a draw in Austria on the final day of group matches. Suarez and Costa were unavailable. Bayern, weakened after confirming top spot, equalled Man Utd's record of longest unbeaten run in the CL at 16 matches. The pair of results against Bayern mirrored the 1974 pair of matches.
