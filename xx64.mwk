=== Raddy Antic ===
His name is revered at the Vicente Calderon, and with similar affection across the city after his spell at the Bernabeu where he succeeded the legendary Alfredo di Stefano in March 1991. He lifted Madrid, including Gheorghe Hagi, Emilio Butragueno and Fernando Hierro, from seventh to first, eight points clear, before being sacked in January 1992. (Leo Beenhakker took over and squandered the lead, losing the title to Barcelona on the last day of the season.)
