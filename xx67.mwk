=== Molina ===
This summer should see the end of Molina's Atletico career after their relegation and the keeper will be eager to put himself in the shop window.
Whether his international career lasts much beyond the Norway game in which he gifted Iversen the winning goal is another matter.

A dominating presence in the Atletico goal for several seasons, he was a member of the Euro 96 squad but has yet to be able to establish himself as number one ahead of Canizares or Antonio Zubizarretta.

Famously made his debut as an outfield player against - of all people - Norway in April 1996.
