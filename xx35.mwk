Our report from week commencing 20th December 1999:

The big news of the week was the sentence by judge García Castellón removing Atlético de Madrid president Jesus Gil and his entire board, and putting an embargo on the club's assets. The sentence makes strong reading. Gil is accused of several things, including illegally taking a majority share in the club, awarding himself and partner Enrique Cerezo 94.5% of the share capital without paying in any capital when the club was incorporated under the sporting companies act. Accounts were apparently falsified to show the club was solvent, which allowed them to remain in the first division, and also take advantage of government subsidies and tax relief, which ended up in the hands of management rather than the club. As a result of the club illegally staying in the top category (insolvent clubs should be relegated) they are also accused of negatively affecting several other clubs who were wrongly relegated or missed out on European competitions (32 clubs are named). Perhaps the most damning accusation however is that four players whose rights were owned by Gil's private company Promociones Futbolisticas, S.A. were transferred to Atlético de Madrid at exorbitant prices to pay off a debt which Gil had run up with the club of 2,700 million Pesetas. One of these, for example, Angolan refugee Bernado Djana is described as a construction worker who was transferred for 2 million Dollars. Another youngster, Maximillian Oliveira, was transferred for 1,100 million Pesetas when his rights already belonged to the club. In all the judge has accused Gil and his associates of expropriating 8,600 million Pesetas from the club. Luis Manuel Rubí Blanc has been named as legal administrator by the judge, and he will take over as president of the club. Jesus Gil denies any wrong doing, and has asked for his arguments to be heard, claiming that the whole thing is being orchestrated by his political enemies. We await his explanation.
